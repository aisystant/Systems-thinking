title: 'Definitions: Coffin for a Dead Thought'

Will "dictionary definitions" help us understand the meaning/concept behind the word? Including a glossary in the course? No, dictionary definitions won't help! You can't say anything about an object except how it relates to other objects. Most definitions are built "according to Aristotle" as genus-differentia definitions---they define what **genus** the object belongs to and then its distinctive features or **species** within that genus (a relationship of specialization). "An orange is a type of citrus from the Rutaceae family, and also the fruit of this tree." In life, such definitions are of little help because different people highlight different distinguishing features useful for various uses of the concept. Their relationships are not genus-differentia but part-whole, implementations, classifications, etc. We always end up with situations involving definitions similar to those described in the joke: "Cheburashka, how do I explain what a helicopter is to you? Do you know an orange? Well, a helicopter is nothing like it!"

**The meaning of a word is defined** **not by its definition, but** **by its usage** **in the context of a language game**^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)>]**. A person's neural network learns the meanings of words in the context of their usage, through examples from** **methods/practices/cultures. The only way to grasp the meaning of a concept is** **to gather multiple examples of its use** **in some practical/activity/cultural/method of work context** **of speaking. Each new example of use will refine the scope of this concept's meaning** **in this context. A definition won't help, but will only confuse: definitions are often used just as a pretext to present several counterexamples, which usually point to different contexts** **of the discussed method/practice.**

Systems thinking isn't reducible to mathematics, although physicists have recently given mathematical grounding to many observed general system behavior patterns in various subject areas---after all, systems primarily refer to physical systems. Providing a strict physical, and within that, mathematical definition of its concepts is impossible.

In natural and even formal languages, there will always be uncertainty in concepts, uncertainty in type assignment. Although this uncertainty can be mitigated by various methods indefinitely, it will remain. Different properties will stand out for different roles of the same system, and different systems will be called by the same words, as each role has its own method/culture/style of work, which sets its typical situations, and thus words in definitions will be used differently.

We will not give reasons to get confused by "definitions" and then deal with their contradictions, insufficiency, inaccuracy, inevitable ambiguity, and distortion in translation from one natural language to another due to the lack of certain concepts and corresponding terms in the other language.

**In systems thinking** **"glossary definitions"** **are often a medicine that turns into a disease.** **In situations of terminological disagreements, use** **not definitions, but** **techniques developed in modern philosophical logic:**

-   If you (or your interlocutor) don't want to change something in the physical world (and thereby explain, i.e., understand the causes and effects), but simply "find the truth" out of curiosity, the argument should end: arguments about "truth" and "terms" are theoretically fruitless. If it's unclear how you will use terms for some action that changes the world (and not just the description of the world---after all, what difference does it make how the world is described if the world itself doesn't change, "paper will bear anything"!), then you don't need to agree, there's no reason to. **If the physical world won't change from the argument's outcome, you can stop arguing, part ways, and not waste time.** **But if the world will change from the argument's outcome (both agreed on joint actions), keep arguing and negotiating the next steps, actions, finding explanations (i.e., discussing causes and effects).**
-   **When describing the unclear, don't go to more general concepts (the path of "dictionary definition"** **by Aristotle), but** **"ground"** **: describe the physical world. Going into more general concepts and describing the unclear as specializations (Aristotelian definitions** **"X is Y with such features") is a dead end.** To agree, it is necessary to concretize, not to abstract---to reduce to the physical known to the disputants, not to the general known to the disputants. For the particular, an opposing poorly definable general is implied, or it's about a "functional role" inexplicably realized in the physical world. Discussing behaviors is always harder than discussing static physical objects, things behaving a certain way. Therefore, for each role-based object, we substitute some understandable constructive/material object (thing) as an example playing the functional object's role---and discuss its behavior, which will become clear immediately.
-   **During terminology discussions** **taboo the term**^[[https://lesswrong.ru/wiki/Tabooing](https://lesswrong.ru/wiki/Tabooing)] **(its use doesn't lead to understanding, only slowing the discussion), provide expanded formulations instead.** If you need to continue the conversation and the interlocutor clearly doesn't understand the term, continue the discussion without that term! In discussions not about terms but about the matter, terms are needed simply to make the discussion more compact, but arguments about terms eliminate all the advantages of using the term, making it simpler without it. If the argument turns into an argument about terms (about "truth" and "correct naming" instead of "what do we do"), that's a red flag of a fruitless argument. Stop arguing and leave the conversation immediately.

When explaining unfamiliar concepts through other unfamiliar concepts, the understanding of **"conceptual distances"**^[[https://lesswrong.ru/w/Expecting_Short_Conceptual_Distances](https://lesswrong.ru/w/Expecting_Short_Conceptual_Distances)] helps. These distances are usually not short: try explaining to a third-grader how to build the current-voltage characteristic for a thyristor. Explain volts, amperes, characteristics, and what a thyristor is. This is pure fiction, populism about "a real pro can explain everything clearly to a child." You don't believe in fairy tales, do you? To explain something complex to a child, you have to teach that child for many years until they become educated. By that time, the child will become an adult.

With a third-grader and explanations of complex concepts for them, everyone understands everything, but two pros often try to "define" their "thyristors" and other sepulki in three phrases---the age difference is small, and it seems that explanations can be given by providing "definitions understandable by a child." But no. No matter how many definitions you give, they won't be of any use. Beware, beware of definitions---this is the medicine that more often turns into a disease than cures. **Georgy Petrovich Shchedrovitsky** **often repeated:** **"Definition is a coffin for a dead thought."** And he was by no means alone in this, though he spoke of the shortcomings of definitions more often, colorfully, and vividly than many other experts on the methods of thinking within the intelligence stack.

In our course, there is no reliance on definitions, no glossary (what's the use of it?!). The last section of the course provides a concise exposition of the first generation systems approach ontology, but it is deliberately titled "Instead of a Glossary: First Generation Systems Approach Ontology" and is a coherent narrative with references to literary sources instead of a set of definitions.

**Bold text** in our document highlights terms where the concept designated by the term is intensively discussed for the first time in the text. Naturally, the course text contains phrases that look like definitions, but they should not be taken as strict definitions. Later on, the course text will present other phrases for these same terms and the concepts they designate that also look like definitions. And then again and again: the text trains your brain's neural network, forming meanings for unfamiliar words, playing the language game.

With each use of a word, the place of the concept hiding behind the term and its synonyms becomes clearer and clearer in the space of meanings. Moreover, terminology often has synonyms as terms from other contexts with different nuances of meaning and other associations. But the uses of terms are not definitions, no. The result of such conceptual work in training the neural network of the living brain through detailed texts using words in an activity/cultural/practical/working context of performing tasks by a method (all by Wittgenstein: the meaning of words is defined by their usage! not definitions!) is achieved in the course of learning, and it is usually good. But from definitions in learning, in disputes, and communication in general (unless it's about mathematics!), the result is only disputes and requests to clarify/change the definition.

Systems thinking is about life, it's not mathematics, where points have no size, parallel lines never meet even at infinity, and they're infinitely long too. In life, things are different, significantly determined by neural networks and neural network representations; thus, attempts to immediately move to strict formalizations are doomed to failure. Systems thinking is not mathematical (to the extent that it is not mathematics describing the space of meanings, for example, the mathematics of neural network representations in large language models), it is about a not too formally structured and not too formally describable life!

The meanings of terms (and any other words, even if not called solemnly "terms") are defined probabilistically, not precisely, through their use in various "real-life" situations. That is, language is defined not by the need to describe something but by the need to describe something to do something. In any work, its objects are important, with which actions of the method/practice/activity/culture/style/engineering/labor are performed---this sets the context for the language game, in which the meanings of words are determined.

In our course, we believe that your guesses about the meanings of terms from the course (and then your guesses about the meanings of terms you will encounter in work projects) will be built through studying detailed texts describing various practical/activity/cultural situations (work situations by some method), studying different relationships of the concepts designated by these words with other concepts designated by other words used nearby. When defining the meanings of words-terms, we do not read definitions but primarily deal with texts and speeches as sets of detailed statements containing the term of interest (even if we are talking about a photograph or diagram, it will still end with you describing them in words and relying on terms in these descriptions---you won't discuss them by grunting!).

So, first, always **deal with words-terms (pay attention to them, and not to a single word but to usage in context! Words are important!)** that we encounter, i.e., define their meaning, extract from these words the nameless concept that has various names in different professional languages of various communities adhering to different work methods/actions, worshiping different dictionaries (including unwritten ones, "jargon") and other terminological standards---and **then work with the concept (ignoring the words-terms!** **From this point on, the initial terms can be replaced!** **Words are not important!)**.

Life is complex, and we simplify it by each time considering just a couple of interrelated concepts (and also omitting long discussions on the nuances of concepts accepted in theories/explanations of certain methods). For this, we avoid discussions about long lists of names for these concepts in different dialects of different communities. **We learn about concepts through their terms. Terms are important!** **Without them, we're lost, can't learn anything!** **Grunting is not an option, it's uninformative!** **But** **we** **never nitpick the terms themselves,** **they are unimportant to us, but the concepts they designate are important!**
