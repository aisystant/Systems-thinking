title: Basic Concepts of the Systems Approach
---

Here are the main concepts/terms of the version of the systems approach and some other transdisciplinary thinking methods of the intelligence stack described in our course. These concepts will be described in detail in the following sections of the course:

Connection to the physical world (these terms are primarily taken from semantics, concept theory, ontology):

-   physical object occupying a place in space-time
-   embodiment (physical objects) versus their descriptions and documents
-   changes (processes, projects, cases) as physical objects
-   events as physical objects
-   role/functional object (role) and constructive/material object (construct) as its affordance/usability, their physicality
-   software as a physical object (source code as a description of software)
-   enterprise/organizational unit as a physical object
-   parts in time
-   methodological time versus system lifetime
-   when two objects coincide in space-time, it's one object (extensionalism)
-   relationship of composition (composition, "whole-part", partition) of physical objects

Methodological/functional/activity-related subjectivity of system description (these terms are mainly taken from methodology as the study of methods of agents' work, including actors playing "roles in the method of work"
functional/professional/activity-related/work/organizational/practical/cultural/stylistic roles, with vast synonymy here):

-   method/way of working, metaphor of role-playing
-   functional/work/project/activity/cultural/org role (stakeholder role): external, internal/team
-   role-related: "subject of interest"/"important characteristic", interest/preference
-   agent, their intention and acting out the work method role as an actor
-   successful system

System division:

-   systems of systems approach versus systematics ("Linnaean system") and norms/rules ("Stanislavski system")
-   system, system level, system division
-   emergence/system effect
-   types of systems: target, ours, subsystem, supersystem, environment (systems in the environment), creators (creation systems)
-   system name (role-based, by function)
-   black and transparent boxes
-   concept of use, system concept
-   engineering justifications

System description and documentation:

-   definition of the system
-   description of the system (documentation)
-   role-specific/private description (view)
-   role-based method of description (viewpoint)
-   model, meta-model, meta-meta-model, multi-model, mega-model
-   projection and synthetic approaches to system description

Functional and constructive parts of the system, placements, and resources:

-   divisions: functional, constructive/material/modular/product/affordance, placements/spatial, cost (candidate: works)
-   conflicts between system levels and inconsistencies
-   functional part (role), its ports, flows/connections
-   constructive/material part (construct), its interface, platform
-   spatial part (placement)
-   resource part (total cost of ownership)
-   architecture
-   functional analysis and constructive/modular synthesis (invention)

This set of systems approach concepts, developed over many years within various fundamental thinking methods, is surprisingly compact: the complex world of diverse situations is represented by a relatively small number of concepts, and this set is chosen to make the world simpler to think about, better understand causality and sources of problems.

The course in the following sections will describe these concepts and their relations as objects and relations of the subject areas of methodology and systems thinking. The last section of the course provides a compact (without justifications and detailed explanations) description of these concepts within the third-generation systems approach with references to literature (there is also a published English translation of this description^[<https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11524>]).
It is these concepts that applied engineering (including levels of organization, community, society levels) discussions rely on when they refer to the systems approach and consider project methods to create successful systems.
