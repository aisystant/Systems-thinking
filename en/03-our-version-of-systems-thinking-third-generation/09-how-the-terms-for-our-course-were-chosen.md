title: How Terms Were Chosen for Our Course
---

Science has traditionally generated new terms (designations for emerging new concepts) in two ways:

-   A common ("colloquial") word was taken and loaded with a special ("scientific") meaning. "Work" in physics is by no means "work" in the everyday sense. Moreover, "work" in the text of our course is also not a colloquial word. Thus, "work" and "method/practice/activity/labor" cannot be confused, they are not synonyms. Moreover, there will be no quotation marks — you might not notice that this is a term! Confusing work and labor in our course is not allowed — it will look something like this, without quotation marks and specifying types. Both work and labor mean behavior. But they are different classes of one class "behavior." "Work" and "labor" here are terms with strict/formal typing, and they are of different types! The "colloquial word" as a "term with special meaning in some method" is the most common way, but it easily leads to confusion with words from colloquial speech, because these are "false friends of a translator" when translating from scientific language to colloquial and vice versa.
-   To make speech more precise, a term was made from a word that had no known meanings in everyday speech. For this, an unusual word for the native ear was taken from a foreign language (most often with a Greek or Latin root) and loaded with a special meaning. Today in Russian language, the captured word can be an English word, not Latin or Greek — it does not have a colloquial meaning in Russian. But this also comes with problems. If you say the Greek word "epistemology," it needs to be explained, and you will have to explain it for a long time, setting the "use of the word in the context of the language game in some activity." But "the study of how to do research" — it seems immediately clear what it is about, but it is not a fact that "epistemology" will be understood under these words, it may equally be "gnoseology," and in it, you will suddenly encounter not only scientific research aiming for knowledge of the world, but also artistic and theological "research." In epistemology, artistic and religious knowledge of the world is usually absent, but in gnoseology, they are usually present. Therefore, very rare words are used to avoid confusion in close but still different meanings of words.

In our course, terms were chosen (including when translating foreign texts — standards, methodologies, textbooks) to maximize the clarity of their use in activities. When choosing terms, it was taken into account: who will understand this word, from which professional community is he, in which dialect does he prefer to speak? This is a different principle than "taking terms from a standard close to the authors and ignoring all other options."

For example, we can easily use jargon words in the course. For instance, "IT specialist" instead of "programmer" — because we care not only about the beauty of speech and familiar terms but also about the most accurate indication of the meanings of terms in the real world. After all, "programmer" is a narrower term than "IT specialist." Database administrator, data modeler, and data engineer, systems administrator, IT architect, electronics specialist — they are not programmers, but IT specialists. The word "IT specialist" could be replaced with "computer specialist" — for someone, it would be even clearer, but someone would start to object. Considering all this, we could write programmer/IT specialist/computer specialist — so no one would be offended, and it would be clearer what meaning of all these terms we mean.

It also happens that a certain term, the meaning of which is very easy to misunderstand, has already become established in the language of a narrow professional group. For example, such is the translation "management" for the term governance. In such cases, our courses will use our own option, which leads to fewer misunderstandings. For example, governance (in the course "Systems Management") will be translated as "accountability" or "supervision" (or even "control" and "oversight," or even "supervision"), and no dictionaries and standards matter here. A similar situation with frustration. This is not "psychological frustration," but geometric disorder/instability. Therefore, no "frustrations" in the translation here will be present, they will only confuse.

If some "process standard" (for example, the systems engineering ISO 15288:2023) by the word process means a concept, referred to in various other places as method/method/practice (characteristic of processes unfolding in time in this "process" from ISO 15288 is not there, it lists "methods/practices/life cycle processes", this standard did not reflect the "continuous everything" method), then in our course this will be "work method," not "process." If you find yourself in a community of people who practice the "process approach" and speak the dialect used in this community, feel free to use the word "process" or "work process," or "organizational process" (but it would be better not to "business process", the cleaner's coming out to wash the floors is clearly not a "business process", and in state organizations "business" is also not encouraged) instead of the word "method" — but know that in doing so you lose the information on the distinction between processes (with step-by-step unfolding over time) and work methods (without such unfolding), and your speech will cause perplexity from time to time: then do not be lazy to clarify the meaning of the term you used. If we distinguish between work and method/practice (and we will distinguish!), then labor — is it work or method? We choose that labor — is a function/practice/culture/style/method of work (this is what the term "division of labor" points to), not work. Therefore, in the course, we will try not to consider labor and work as synonyms. But you can easily find a community where they will not be distinguished, and you will need to take this into account in your conversations in this community.

Usually, the same term in even one speaking community has many different meanings, so clarifying the meaning of even a very common term is never superfluous. For example, Andries van Renssen identified^[p. 79 in <https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:de26132b-6f03-41b9-b882-c74b7e34a07d/datastream/OBJ/download> (Gellish: A generic extensible ontological language - design and application of a universal data structure)] the following commonly used by the IT community meanings for the term "**function**":

-   a subtype of activity (behavior), process, or event;
-   some object, in a specific role or made for a specific role;
-   the role of the object itself (usually this is the role of a constructive/material object, a thing) participating in activity (behavior). Played role (functional object) and constructive/material object playing the role are different! Role — Hamlet, the object playing this role — Vysotsky;
-   indication of correlation/dependence, usually as a physical connection between some aspects: "if height increases, then the pressure falls";
-   mathematical relation between numerical objects, defining their mapping to each other.

This means that often instead of the word "function," you can use the word "action," or "role," or even "dependence" — and the conversation will become more precise.

The often encountered term "**meta**" is used in six different meanings, expressing six different types of relationships^[<https://ailev.livejournal.com/1053878.html>]:

-   instantiation (relationship type and instance);
-   grouping (relationship type and subtype), also categorization (philosophical, not from category theory, the term “category” is loved by very different speaking communities and denotes different things in them!);
-   description (relationship description and described object);
-   application/stereotype (relationship pattern and its implementation);
-   variation (relationship main model and customized);
-   realization (relationship abstract syntax and corresponding expression. This is in computer science, because the cited work belongs to computer science. But we remember that we will also have another meaning of the term "realization" — this is the relationship of fulfilling the role of a functional object by some constructive object).

Therefore, every time you encounter the word "meta," you need to figure out which of these six meanings was meant.

**Never get attached to the specific word-terms chosen by others!** **Words-terms are extremely important because besides them we have nothing else for communication. But** **words** **as sequences of letters** **in written text or sequences of phonemes** **in speech** **are never** **unequivocal, they are merely “labels” on concepts. Each time try to understand what is actually being talked about, what meaning of the word was meant in each specific case, reach for the concept/meaning of the term.** **Words-terms are not that important, they are only needed to get to the meaning or understand what subject area we are talking about at all!**

Using terms from standards does not guarantee unambiguous understanding by the interlocutor, but using ambiguous words does not necessarily lead to difficulties. This course will not attempt to define precise definitions, nor will it attempt to choose the correct terms for the concepts of the course. We will try to convey the understanding of the most important concepts and suggest different words that can denote them. For the question "what's two times two?" answers such as IV, 4, "four," and four will be accepted. But don't delude yourself: answers like "pot", 5, "per aspera ad astra" — will not be accepted.
