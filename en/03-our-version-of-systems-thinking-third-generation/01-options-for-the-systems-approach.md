title: Variants of the Systems Approach
---

**Systems thinking** is thinking with the use of the core concepts and mental techniques of the **systems approach**. There are many different variants of the systems approach, significantly differing from each other in terms of elaboration, terminology used, and details, but coinciding in their fundamentals. The main feature of all variants of the systems approach is the multi-level consideration of the system as a part of a supersystem **first**, and then considering subsystems as parts of the system. This mental process (first to the supersystem, "upwards" through systems levels, then to the subsystem, "downwards" through systems levels) is performed up and down multiple levels.

The focus is exclusively on identifying systems, supersystems, and subsystems with direct attention on the operating/functioning system. No physical dismantling of the system into individual parts is performed. During the physical assembly/disassembly when creating the system (not during use/work/operation), such "constructional" consideration of the structural/material parts of the system also exists, but it is not the main focus in systems thinking. The main aspect is during use/work/operation, and these functional parts of the system (functional objects, roles) are highlighted by attention. To retain attention, recording is used—systems thinking foresees systems modeling; it does not happen purely "in the mind." If you do not write, you do not think! This "highlighting by attention" and recordings to prevent loss of attention during mental distractions were discussed in more detail in the "Rational Work" course.

The systems approach first appeared in physics. The concept of a system in the modern systems approach is more developed than the concept of a system in physics. A system in physics is just part of the world/universe under consideration. In this respect, there is a specific part of the whole world as a system, the boundary of the system, and the entire surrounding world outside the system's boundary as an environment. Systems in physics (e.g., the concept of a thermodynamic system) were not long considered a full-fledged systems approach, because multi-levelness of systems was rarely discussed in physics: discussing systems consisting of certain parts within an environment was sufficient. Nevertheless, the concept of a system in physics is still actively used^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system>].

The systems approach as the basis of systems thinking, specifically under the name systems thinking, first appeared in biological material. Biologists tried to describe a flood meadow as a whole with its hundreds of species of plants and animals and year-round changes. Living organisms cannot be disassembled into parts, making the meadow an exceptionally complex object for description and understanding. Therefore, **systems thinking emerged as managing the movement of the researcher's attention across different levels of division of the whole system into parts (or vice versa, assembling the whole system from individually highlighted parts by attention).**

The foundations of the systems approach underwent significant development since its proposal in 1937 by biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy>] **General Systems Theory**. Generally, an **approach** is when concepts, methods of thinking, action techniques, and supportive tools developed within one method in one subject area are then applied to other subject areas. The General Systems Theory was mainly developed from the system concept from physics applied to biological material (something like "physics theory for biologists"), and then proposed for application to many other subject areas ("general systems theory," already detached from the biological field).

Today, proposing some significant types of objects and relations in a subject area is often called a framework, which also translates as "approach". This "approach"/framework represents some kind of ontic (a private ontology, not reconciled with other ontics in other subject areas; after all, ontology implies some general understanding of objects and relationships existing in the world), defined not in formal mathematical language, but as not too formal textual descriptions. We will further note that the higher the level of abstraction of such "approaches," the less they will resemble "mathematical formalisms," and the more they will be expressed in texts in natural language, defining concepts and relationships through examples of their use in texts, not through mathematical formal definitions, as in mathematics. Intellectual agents today are not logical computers but living people and AI agents working not in local/symbolic (like mathematicians, "with formulas"), but in distributed (like in the brain or computer neural network) representations, non-symbolic (you may think of "holography" as an example of non-local representations, though there are many different variants of these non-local representations^[<https://ailev.livejournal.com/1281819.html>]). At such a low level of formality, the set of objects and relationships of the systems approach/approach/framework is also described, even though initial works on the systems approach tried to inherit a more formal description language from physics, which introduced the system concept.

The ontology of our variant of systems thinking is provided (with literature sources from where these concepts are taken) in a concise form in the last section of our course, and it is also done as text in natural language referring to literature sources, which are also texts in natural language. But it is important to emphasize: **the systems approach implies texts presented not within the framework of prototype theory of concepts (many metaphors, arbitrary typification), but within the framework of theoretical theory of concepts (strict typification of objects and relationships).** If you did not understand the highlighted fragment of the previous text, you absolutely need to retake the prerequisite course "Rational Work."

Since the emergence of General Systems Theory in the 1930s, entire disciplines/theories have arisen and died based on the systems approach. For example, **cybernetics** was born in 1948 and then forgotten in the seventies. Hence, it is still possible to encounter old versions of the systems approach intertwined with cybernetics, bearing all its shortcomings, primarily the attempt to reduce all understanding of the world to the operation of homeostasis-maintaining systems with feedback loops.

Cybernetics was actively used in state planning and proved inadequate: the economy itself is nonequilibrial; there is no "balance of supply and demand" returning to equilibrium because the economy evolves and changes rather than balances around some "equilibrium." Remnants of cybernetics now exist only as automatic control theory, where one indeed needs to manage some constant parameter in a technical system, monitoring "deviations." But in most situations, it is not about "deviations" from an equilibrium point but about moving toward goals and relying on non-equilibrium states. Modern descriptions of the interaction of systems and the surrounding world (e.g., active/embodied inference theory) do not imply highlighting a "control system" in a simple "feedback loop," and they are based on other assumptions about the principles of system-environment interaction than cybernetics.

The most widespread version of the cybernetic systems approach is reflected in the "system dynamics" modeling method (system dynamics^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics>]) and boils down to finding and explicitly reflecting in the model certain relationships that can form cycles, leading to oscillations around some equilibrium position. Such "cybernetic modeling" is over-simplified and poorly represents various kinds of systems, which are very different from the cybernetic "Watt governor."

Development, evolution are well described by systems representations but poorly described by "control" representations, that is, by cybernetics representations. In general, modeling different types of connections (electrical, chemical, economic, etc.) on the same systems level (and even on different systems levels) is performed by arbitrary systems of differential equations. Sometimes this arbitrary systems of differential equations description in engineering are called "systems modeling," but it is much broader than the narrow class of "system dynamics" equations. However, this is already not quite a systems approach; it is simply simulation modeling of systems in "hardware" engineering (and sometimes organizational systems). Thus, if you see "systems modeler," it does not necessarily mean the systems approach and systems thinking—most often, it is about "systems modeling" as a variant of a-causal simulation modeling of cyber-physical systems, mostly in Modelica language. As with system dynamics, there is a lot of diverse software for this purpose^[<https://modelica.org/tools/>]. So, a System Modeler from Wolfram^[<https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/>] is not necessarily a modeler supporting the systems approach and systems thinking. It is just a tool for physical modeling of cyber-physical systems ("hardware" systems with controlling computers, the "cyber" part).

The systems approach has already gained wide acceptance in engineering and management. In engineering in the 1950s-60s, the "mathematical" understanding of the systems approach prevailed, which boiled down simply to the active use of mathematical modeling in solving engineering problems ("systems modeling" as simulation modeling—the echoes of those times). "Systematicity" consisted of compiling models from the most various theories/disciplines, both natural sciences and engineering (electricity, mechanics, chemistry for chemical reactions, calculations of pressure changes, heat and mass transfer, etc.) for different levels of the system's structure (the system as a whole and its subsystems of various levels).

Descriptions of specific "systems" were carried out using numerous models reflecting different properties of interest to engineers and scientists in various situations.

Most often, this significantly math-bound simulation modeling ("system modeling") was contrasted with the so-called **reductionism** (reducing to the simple).

For reductionism, declared main in science (this is "reducing to the simple," dividing into ever-smaller parts—scientificness was sought here, "how to explain the complex by the work of the simple"), it was typical to highlight one primary point of view, one theory/discipline, and modeling method for some level of the structure of the object or subject of study. For example, a person was considered at the molecular level (i.e., the biochemical level), and all knowledge about human nature was derived from this: his thinking and social behavior were explained as a complex combination of biochemical processes.

The systems approach overcame the obvious absurdity of single-level simplification of reductionism, and therefore it became very popular. **To think systemically** is above all to keep in mind the level of the system's fragmentation into parts at which it is appropriate to discuss the emerging properties on that level, which were not yet on the previous levels of system fragmentation and are no longer on levels above the system, on the supersystem level. **These properties are necessary for ease of action in the physical world.**

The systems approach does not imply a simple physical or mathematical-logical understanding of the "part-whole" relationship. For example, "the house consists of bricks"—this is a true statement in physics and mathematics but false in the systems approach. In the systems approach, it will be noted that another level in the system's fragmentation into parts ("consists of"—this refers to the composition/part-whole relationship) is missed: walls! If you are planning to build a house, indicating the position of each brick to compactly describe the house is very wrong. It is much simpler to describe how walls are made of bricks and then describe how the house is made of walls. Systems are introduced when their introduction allows describing something more compactly, conveniently, and simply for action in the physical world.

The taste of borscht during its cooking must be discussed as dependent on the method of preparation from pieces of vegetables and meat; discussing the ongoing biochemical processes at the cellular level during cooking is inadequate. These processes are definitely happening during cooking, but they are the wrong level of structure to discuss the taste of borscht! The understanding of how meat protein folds during the cooking of borscht, of course, directly relates to the change in the taste of raw meat to cooked, but it is unlikely to help the cook! Attention must highlight whole vegetables and their pieces, cooking techniques, and the dependence of taste on these techniques, discussed at this level of coarseness: whole vegetables and pieces of meat, cut into small pieces, as accepted in different cuisines (slightly larger in southern cooking, slightly smaller in northern). And you can’t discuss the taste of borscht if you discuss a six-course dinner where borscht will be just one of the courses: the dinner as a whole does not "have the taste of borscht," although borscht is a part of it. The main point is the highlighting with attention real situations of cooking borscht and dining situations for the needed goals (making dinner with tasty borscht).

About the reductionism "borscht from folded proteins" will be all the same arguments as about a "house of bricks".

The situation with the house or borscht seems simple, but let's take the project of creating an airliner, which plans for 6 million individual parts. How will you and a huge team of a couple of hundred thousand people engaged in its manufacturing at factories in different countries consider this airliner to not miss anything important? At the material level from which this airliner consists? This will be correct if calculating the strength of the airliner. But if calculating the lift of its wings, the material level will not help. A complex system of millions of individual parts must be described at many levels of its assembly into the whole, describing for different purposes in various ways, and not losing any! **Systems thinking helps not lose the attention of thousands of people, not forget anything important** **when dividing into parts or assembling the whole from parts, not be distracted to irrelevant matters.**

Managing the attention to 6 million individual parts in the airliner to not forget any part and considering aerodynamics, passenger capacity, overall project cost, lightning strike safety, assembly plant size—doing all this became not an intellectual feat but a routine mental task after the appearance of systems thinking in engineering. And names of genius aircraft designers like Messerschmitt and Tupolev remained in the past; for modern, more complex airplanes, it is no longer necessary to have geniuses on the team! Systems thinking, supported by computers (even without AI), copes well. It is no longer necessary to have an absolute genius like Korolev to conduct such complex space launches as SpaceX is doing now.

Through this fight against reductionism, they reached the point in the seventies when systems thinking began to be declared **holistic,** which means it speaks about the primacy of the whole over the parts. In holism, the behavior of the parts is explained by the existence of the whole. But **holism** turned out to be as much a mistake as reductionism: **systems thinking** **fights both the complete rejection of considering the dependencies of the whole’s behavior as the behavior of its parts (reductionism) and the complete rejection of considering the dependencies of the parts' behavior due to what is happening to the whole (holism).**

The word "system" in the late seventies became respectable, and it began to be used even by those entirely unfamiliar with the systems approach in any of its versions, who did not understand the essence of the systems approach, its method of managing attention when considering complex situations. In fact, the word "system" suddenly became synonymous with the word "object"—something that fell into our sphere of attention. The connection with attention remained, but the specificity of dealing with a specific level of coarseness of cutting into objects, the multitude of levels and ways of cutting, was completely lost. Users of the word "system" did not have any systems thinking, which afterwards would work with "object-systems."

This "pop" understanding of the word "system" was inherited by modern AI systems (Bard, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). Unfortunately, you cannot maintain a conversation with them about modern systems thinking: in everyday understanding, the word "system" is not a type of object as in the systems approach, but "almost a synonym" for an object. Instead of a theoretical theory of concepts and its strict/formal typification (slow thinking S2 by Kahneman^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow>]), artificial intelligence systems use a prototype theory of concepts with its loose analogies as the basis of thought (fast thinking S1 by Kahneman) from everyday speech. Therefore, be cautious in discussing systems thinking with AI systems (and with laypeople); the word "system" is known to everyone—but for all of them, it is not a type of object from the systems approach, and not everyone can track the strict use of the type!

In the eighties, numerous textbooks on the systems approach appeared in management, with no mathematics. The emphasis was on the fact that in a system "everything is connected to everything," while essential connections could be lost in traditional mono-disciplinary considerations (again fighting reductionism!). Therefore, it was necessary to involve various people to reveal these critical connections through their communication.

The managerial presentation of the systems approach was valuable in drawing attention to the need to consider the creating systems (usually consisting of people organized into enterprises) when discussing some target systems. Later, considering these people became mandatory, and it was no longer about individuals but their roles in the project called stakeholders. Sometimes stakeholders meant role players, and sometimes the roles themselves—a stakeholder in "engineer Vasya" was considered Vasya by some and engineer by others. In our course, we avoid saying "stakeholder" and call the engineer a role, and Vasya the agent playing roles, including the role of engineer. In any case, discussing the target system without the creating systems became incorrect; thus, in the eighties, a second generation of the systems approach appeared. Although role players and the roles themselves are still confused, with the term stakeholder used very differently, be careful here.

In managerial books on the system approach, on each recommendation "consider system integrity," "think holistically," "view problems from different perspectives," there should have been another ten on precisely how to do it. For each “think holistically” reminder, not forgetting about the parts of the system, holism is as useful and harmful as reductionism. Managerial systems thinking (this is a vast number of books! If you start googling, you will most likely find managerial books) did not emphasize the multi-level fragmentation of the system into parts; various ways of fragmentation (e.g., functional parts—convenient for discussing the system's functioning/operation, structural parts—for discussing what the system is made of) were not considered.

For example, take scissors: functionally, there are the blade block and handle (usage time, explaining “how they work”), and structurally—two ends, two loops, and a pin in the middle (manufacturing time, “how and what to make”). Both descriptions (further, we will learn that more such descriptions are needed) are required to design, manufacture, and then operate the scissors. Now find such distinctions of different fragmentations in the “pop” books on systems thinking in management. No, there wouldn't be any (in our course—it will be!), just saying that “the system should be described in various ways.” This is understood even without textbooks that it should be various ways. But which ways exactly?

The answer to this question was absent in managerial books; it was simply postulated that “it is necessary to think about parts and the whole; this is extremely useful,” and that's it. In engineering books on systems thinking (more precisely, books on the use of systems thinking in engineering—books on systems engineering), the answer to this question (“how many minimally necessary ways to fragment the system into parts?”) was given; over time, the number of these ways increased—
