title: Reliance on Standards and Public Documents of Systems Engineering and Management
  in Our Version of the Systems Approach
---

The version of the systems approach we present in our course is based
primarily on the material of **standards** and **public documents**
of systems engineering. To the engineering standards, we have added some
management standards like enterprise engineering. A public document is a standard for which no procedure for conformity assessment is defined. Otherwise, everything else is the same: the specification is issued by a collective, regularly reviewed. Public documents serve the purpose of informing, spreading knowledge, and not for unification. These are mainly materials from the second generation of the systems approach, "target systems which are conceived, created, and operated by system creators from teams of people."

Of course, we have added modern ideas of the third-generation systems
approach that have appeared in the last five years in physics, biology, and
also control systems engineering, about which we wrote in previous sections (scalelessness, including not only scales of size but also scales of time, including Darwinian/biological evolution and
techno-evolution, non-anthropomorphic presentation, conflicts between
objects of different system levels, and indeterminacies).

Nevertheless, the main concepts and terminology are taken from the engineering and
management versions of the systems approach, and not from academic
literature. From these standards and public documents, we took the main
concepts and their terminology and only slightly adapted these concepts and
terminology, making the link between the concepts defined in different standards and public documents obvious.

Reliance on standards is important also because the standards and
public documents themselves are regularly reviewed, every few years.
This allows not to lag behind reality, as the texts of Bertalanffy's General Systems
Theory (GST), which can still be found in bookstores and on the internet even today (we remember that these ideas were first proposed in the 1930s), have fallen behind by dozens of years. The version of the systems approach we present in the course will also become outdated someday (this has already happened! The current text --- is the result of the ninth revision!), but by relying on regularly reviewed standards and public documents, as well as regularly published scientific articles, this can be noticed (as we noticed the recent shift from "interdisciplinarity" to "transdisciplinarity" in public documents of systems engineering, the recent discovery of the role of indeterminacies from conflicts between system levels as a basis for the growth of complexity in biological, mimetic, and techno-evolution, the departure from requirements engineering in systems engineering, the departure from the concept of the life cycle to "continuous everything").

In our version of the systems approach, the following versions
of engineering and management standards and public documents were used (this list is far from exhaustive, only the main
sources are provided^[For many of these standards, there are
official Russian-language versions as GOST, but we did not rely on them. Firstly, we are more interested in international, not national standards. We hope that our textbook will be used not only in Russia, and the knowledge obtained from it will be universal for different countries. Secondly, translations of international
standards for the purposes of "gosting" are carried out under economic contracts without special attention to their quality and
harmonization of the terminology used in different international standards. Therefore, we do not use the terms defined by translated GOSTs. Thirdly, international standards are continuously reviewed,
and translations usually lag behind the current content of the standards, they
are only available for past, obsolete versions.]):

-   The **ISO/IEC/IEEE** **15288:2023** **Systems** **and**
    **software** **engineering --- System life cycle processes**
    defines the very concept of the system and the life cycle, distinguishes the target system, systems in the environment, and creation systems, introduces the concept of life cycle methods/processes/practices. Although it is significantly out of date, as it mainly implies one-time development and includes requirements engineering methods, which are already irrelevant in engineering (this became irrelevant around 2017, but international standards of this level change slowly).
    But we still use many concepts introduced by this standard.
-   The generalized standard from purely recommendations for architectural
    documentation creation to complete system documentation
    **ISO/IEC/IEEE** **42010:2022** **Systems and software
    engineering --- Architecture description** brings multiplicity of descriptions and action-oriented approach. This is a "mind turn" from the reductionist approach of one-sided description to the systems approach, implying a multiplicity of related descriptions in various information systems.
-   The generalized standard from software to systems engineering **OMG
    Essence** **1.2:2018 --- Kernel and Language for Software
    Engineering Methods** defines a language for describing the method of creating and developing a system in terms of work methods/practices. This standard also introduces checklists/control questions. We use not so much its Kernel (set of basic alphas) but its Language (the very concept of alphas as an important object, for which the state is tracked in the project of creating and developing the system).
-   The **IEC** **81346-1:2022** **Industrial** **systems,**
    **installations** **and** **equipment** **and** **industrial**
    **products --- Structuring principles and reference
    designations --- Part 1: Basic rules** is used for the minimal necessary description of the structure of complex engineering
    objects, setting the principles for the designation of systems and their parts. This is the foundation for configuration management during the life cycle.
    Furthermore, this standard distinguishes three types of descriptions:
    functional, product-related, and location, although it does not touch upon the need for cost description, already mandatory for today's systems thinking.
-   The **ISO 15926-2:2003** **Industrial automation systems and
    integration --- Integration of life-cycle data for process
    plants including oil and gas production facilities --- Part 2:
    Data model** serves for modeling data of deployed (complete)
    descriptions of engineering objects. Supports the integration of data from various information systems of the life cycle of engineering
    objects. It is important to us for introducing the concepts of 4D extensionalism, which economizes thinking by transforming a large number of relationships into part-whole relationships if these objects are represented not as objects in space (3D) but as objects in space-time (4D).
-   The public document **NIST** **PWG** **Cyber-Physical** **Systems**
    **(CPS)** **Framework** **Release** **1.0** **(2016)** clarifies
    the ways of describing cyber-physical systems, introduces the classification
    of aspects for important characteristics of systems/objects of interest
    of project roles.
-   The public document **Guide** **to** **the** **Systems**
    **Engineering** **Body** **of** **Knowledge** **(SEBoK):2023** gives
    us the definition of a successful system and many other definitions
    of the systems approach.

Let us repeat: most of these standards and public documents do not yet
take into account the changes of the last five years in methods of modern systems
engineering and other methods of the knowledge stack, so our course does not fully
follow these standards (previous versions of the course, corresponding to
the previous generation of systems thinking, corresponded more), but
does maintain continuity. Thus, in standards, there is generally a reference to
the life cycle of the system as a one-time passage through work methods
/"work processes" of the life cycle. In modern systems
thinking, the concept of **"continuous everything"**: methods of creating and
developing a system, considering the constant development of the system as the constant creation of new versions of the system, not a one-time creation
of the system, carrying it "from birth to death," as in biology. Our course reflects this transition to the methods of "continuous everything" in engineering.

We guaranteed the universality of our version of systems thinking by actually using it in various projects ---
engineering, management, the start of new activities, pedagogical, cultural, artificial intelligence, research, etc. (we are talking not only about projects carried out by systems engineers worldwide but also about projects by the course authors, and projects of numerous graduates of previous versions of the course). The course with its modern version of systems thinking is not a result purely of academic work with texts,
it is the result of numerous trials of the proposed version
of systems thinking in real projects.
