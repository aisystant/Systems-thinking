title: Systems — this is not systematicity
---

In systems engineering, which uses systems thinking as
its primary method of thinking, it is emphasized that it is both
**systemic** and **systematic**.

In science and engineering, **systems** is usually understood as following
a systems approach --- **a special**
**fundamental/transdisciplinary (external in relation to any applied subject**
**discipline, but deeply penetrating into the**
**thinking** **of this applied/subject discipline)** **a set of**
**types/concepts** **and their relationships,** **which directs**
**the engineer's attention** **to the main things that need to be thought about** **first of all** **for successful world change:** **"system," "system level," "disorder,"** **and others.**

**Systematicity** is something completely different, it is simply honest formal
(not substantive) consistent attention to what needed to be paid attention to. If you “formally” (i.e., without considering
the content) do not miss certain objects in your attention and actions that you should have touched upon, then you are systematic. Discipline (in all senses of the word --- both subject-specific and administrative, “following the algorithm for performing actions with objects of the subject area”) of any
method must be respected, systematicity is about this. It is necessary to honestly/systematically complete all difficult mental steps, systematically/without omissions
carry out recommended reasoning to ensure confidence in getting
results. And if it also concerns actions in the physical world, then
they must also be honestly completed.

If it is required to fill every cell of a 10*10 table, it is necessary
to focus, gather --- and systematically (i.e., completely without
omissions, accurately and without typos, in the specified order) fill it out. This is not
systems, but it is systematic. It is tedious and time-consuming.
Systematicity does not imply systems. You can systematically
check off each point of some absolutely nonsystemic
instruction, and carry out all its crazy prescriptions, without skipping a single point, bringing it to completion, but there will be no
systems in this, that is, there will be no use of the concepts of the systems
approach.

**Systems** is about the content of thinking, about the concepts
of systems thinking. It is the content of the checklist, which is determined
by the systems approach, and which must be checked by your thinking ---**
pay attention to the concepts of the systems approach. Systems lies in finding the target system among all systems, finding the supersystem, finding the creation system and even the whole chain of creation systems. If you do this absolutely
unmethodically but chaotically --- you are still systemic!

**Systematicity** is about documentation and objects of the surrounding
world, i.e., about ensuring that not a single item in some (potentially completely
nonsystemic) checklist is missed, that all planned tasks are completed,
and the results of these tasks documented.

Systematicity immediately implies a huge amount of varied (both
substantively necessary and substantively unnecessary, although this
“substantively unnecessary” may be “administratively necessary” to some
bureaucrats from a neighboring organizational system) mental work,
which is also to be documented. Systematicity implies persistence in
some details with the perseverance of a maniac. Systems increases the likelihood
that it's important work (you are working with important objects, attention to
which is directed by the systems approach), not a mix of important and trivial (you work with all sorts of objects, some of which turn out to be
important). Systems and systematicity, nevertheless, live hand in
hand, they are in
balance^[<https://incoseuk.org/Normal_Files/WhatIs/Systems_Engineering>,

The importance of systematicity applies not only to the method of systems
thinking. Systematicity is needed for any activity. A person
engaged in systemic fitness based on
somatomechanics^[Chain of texts "Systemic Fitness",
<https://ailev.livejournal.com/1429126.html>, in 2021,
systemic fitness as an engineering method was reformulated based on the concepts
of somatomechanics, as fitness as bodily engineering is fundamentally
mechanics (understood as physics' mechanics: statics and dynamics) of the
soma (the human body, perceived from within by the person themselves, not by an external
observer).] can know in their mind how to create a luxurious mobile body. But if they systematically do not
perform the prescribed method of “five sets of exercises for 30
seconds each,” as well as systematically determine beforehand which part
of their body is the most problematic, so that these five sets bring
irreplaceable benefits, this will not mean that they practice
systemic fitness as an engineering method/practice. They may even be systemic (using the concepts of the systems approach and
somatomechanics), but not systematic: they would miss important actions in
thinking, important actions in the physical world. **To achieve results
in any projects, both systems and
systematicity are needed. Simultaneously. Discipline of thinking and discipline of
action.** **Check what is prescribed by systems thinking ---** **work with the given types of objects
(systems), check everything prescribed** **by working methods** **without omissions
(systematicity).**
