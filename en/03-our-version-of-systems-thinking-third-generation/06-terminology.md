title: Terminology
---

**Terminology**^[[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Терминология](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Терминология)] ---
is the study/knowledge/discipline about words that designate **concepts.**
Concepts, "concepts" and "concepts" for our course can quite act
as synonymous terms, although in some scientific schools the Russian words
"concept" and "concept" mean different things, and in English the broad concept is sometimes called
notion^[<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notion>].
"Terminology" also has two terminological meanings:

1.  a set of term-words to express types and relationships of the ontology
    of some subject area and
2.  The study/discipline not about the concepts themselves, but specifically about the designations
    of concepts with words, about **terms**.

This is just like with geometry and logic --- both specific versions of geometry
and logic, and the study of what geometries and logics there can be in general.

In each language, sets of terms (terminology in the first sense) have formed
(or continue to form) for concepts from various fields of
human culture/activity/methods of work. And in these areas,
terms acquire meanings, i.e. they designate (since they are "signs", they
"designate") some objects and their relationships that exist in the real world, not in the world of signs.
Terminology thereby can be considered part of semantics as a general study of objects,
their designations, and the concepts of these objects. This was already touched upon in the course
"Rational Work", and will also be further explained in the course
"Intellect-Stack".

A term is always just a word. We need words only to agree on concepts,
the words themselves are not important. So,
it absolutely does not matter whether you use the term "concept" or the term
"concept," if you mean the same thing: the meaning of what
is designated by the term. There are many dialects, disputes about which dialect
is the "true language" (whether to translate viewpoint in Systems thinking
as "point of view", "description method", thus saying "viewpoint", or
still translate "aspect", as will be "the only
correct"?!), they are fruitless, these disputes cannot be resolved.

Arguments between people on the most important issues of life and death often turn out
to be just "arguments about terms": the same object
is called differently in different dialects and people believe they are talking about
different objects (the example of Venus is given in philosophical literature: in
some countries it is called "morning star", and in others --- "evening
star"), or vice versa --- the same words mean completely different
objects ("mowing with a scythe with a curved scythe on a spit").

In such "arguments about terms", it is important to recognize that this is not a
substantive conversation, but merely an argument about terms. To stop
such fruitless disputes, it is necessary to formulate your ideas about
the world in speech as expected observations, not through terminology from your
favorite dialect, even if it is taken from your favorite standard
or dictionary. Your interlocutor may have another
favorite standard or dictionary, they may speak in another unfamiliar dialect --- and you will not come to an agreement on the matter itself, just get stuck
discussing words. So if you try to talk to someone about
intelligence or dance, you are unlikely to agree: each person interprets
"intelligence" in their own way, just as "dance." It will be roughly understood
that it is about some "cleverness" or "movement to music",
but nothing can be discussed in detail: you will get stuck in a long discussion
of what you understand by "intelligence" (the word!) and what your interlocutor understands by "intelligence" (the word!), as well as the same
will be with the word "dance." People recognize that in a dictionary each word has
many meanings, but then insist that you use
only the meaning they prefer
 --- and it would be better for you to refrain from other meanings of the word or come up with
a new word for them. The use of the terms themselves, if there is no agreement on their dictionary meanings, will be useless
in conversation, reducing to an eternal fruitless argument about terms. But if there is no argument, and the word's meaning is perceived differently, you will get a "false friend of the translator" from professional slang to everyday language --- and then
intractable and hard-to-find errors in thinking.

If you feel that you cannot agree on some simple
term, try to taboo its use, i.e. continue
the conversation without using this term, just not to get confused. For
you cannot convince the interlocutor that you use
a different dictionary meaning for some word. In our course, we did
this with the words "stakeholder"/stakeholder, the word "dance", the word
"enabling"/enabling. Students' use of these words caused
mistakes. For example, "enabling system" was perceived not as a
system-creator, enabling the realization of the system in the physical world, but as something like a "supply service" --- a power supply system,
catering, gas station, parts supply. This
could not be overcome by any explanations, the mistakes were made by almost every
first student. The solution: all these word-terms that provoke mistakes
were tabooed. They are no longer in the course.

When you understand the content of the conversation under the conditions of tabooing
the term, just name different objects that you called with your
interlocutor with one term, different words-terms, and continue
the conversation --- there will be no more "arguments about terms."

The use of certain terms for certain concepts
(for example, "car", and never "автомобиль") signifies belonging to a certain
community that prefers to use these terms, speaking in their own dialect. But there are other communities,
using other terms for the same concept. It is important to agree, and
terms are not important. In Systems thinking, which
is transdisciplinary/fundamental, this is given great attention:
**thinking goes in** **concepts** **(types and relationships), not in
words**. Words can evoke some associations, they can be
useful for this, but thinking still goes in concepts.

People who have never seen a car in their life, members of the Mumba-Yumba tribe, do not know the concept designated by the word "car" at all. But people
who are aware of the existence of cars and do not know each other's terms will not be able
to agree if one demands "car" and the other --- offers
an incomprehensible "автомобиль". But here at least there will be
a suspicion that the problem is in different languages. But when one demands
a cart, and they are given a garden cart, not the expected car --- and
insist, then in real projects there is a problem.

Terminology is transient, concepts survive longer. During the USSR,
a computer was called an EVM (electronno-vychislitel'naya mashina), but now it is already "computer." The meaning has not changed, the speech has changed --- that is,
the term, the word-designation has changed. And speech-words change much
faster than the objects they designate: the word "тачка" is already going out
of fashion for the meaning "car" as "not slang enough" in
certain circles and is gradually being replaced there by the word "тачило."
The computer is no longer necessarily an electronno-vychislitel'naya mashina, it can be
a quantum or optical computer/computer/calculator. EVM turned out to be just a reference to a specific hardware implementation not through
hydraulics, pneumatics, mechanics, but "electronics" --- the engagement in the mode of **electronic keys**^[<https://studbooks.net/2347860/tehnika/elektronnye_klyuchi>] first with electronic radio tubes, and then discrete transistors and then
transistors on semiconductors (the key switches a "door" from the
state "open" to "closed", and back). But try googling
"electronic key," and you will find that the main meaning of this term
has also changed! This is both an "electronic signature key," and just a key from
a door with an "electronic filling."

Terminology can differ significantly not only for different
professions but also for different sub-professions within one profession.
What is called "software" for systems analysts working
by state standards will be an "application" for foreign software vendors, or
"soft" for developers.

If the inability to agree on terms becomes a real
problem that hinders the implementation of the project --- there are different
approaches to solving it:

-   **Terminological fascism**, when only one term is declared
    by someone as correct, and all the others --- incorrect (compare with
    "Grammar nazi"^[<https://neolurk.org/wiki/Grammar_nazi>]).
    This approach has many variations --- demanding
    the uniqueness of the term used (the absence of synonyms for
    the term), also demanding compliance with the accepted standards
    (certain state standards, for example, and not textbooks or other state standards),
    demanding the use of a native root in the word ("mokrastuples"
    instead of "galoshes"), insisting on following traditions ("калоши", but
    not "галоши"), ignoring modern norms ("coffee" only
    masculine, although it has been possible to use the neutral gender according to dictionaries for a long time).
-   **Terminological indifference**, when words and their meanings are generally
    disregarded. No "deliberately correct options" or
    references to authoritative sources. At the same time, if the meaning of a word changes during the conversation, this often
    is not tracked at all, the speech turns out to be "not strict."
-   **Strictness of meanings** **(maintenance of type)** **with permission**
    **of various** **synonymous terms designating the same concept.**
    With this approach, it usually takes a long time to agree on which particular
    concept is meant, and then any word-terms are used
    to point to the agreed concept. At the same time,
    the use of terms preferred by different professional
    speech communities is allowed. Moreover, it is also possible not to use specific
    terms if the meaning is clear. Thus, when discussing
    a car, calling it a "self-propelled cart" is quite acceptable, and this will not
    be a crime if the recipient understands what it is about.

In our course, an **approach will be used, achieving strictness
of understanding meanings** **(concepts), with the possibility of using**
**different** **synonymous designations, thus different terms for the same concept.** Call it even a pot, even use five terms from
five different standards in three languages --- but agree on what concept/concept you mean: interlocutors should understand not
the term but what you mean by this term: understand
the meaning-concept, not the sign-term. This is discussed by semantics, the study
of meanings. Systems thinking is based not only on the theory of concepts and
ontology, it is also based on semantics. For fluency in Systems
thinking, it is necessary to be somehow familiar with all other methods of thinking in the intellect-stack.

When several synonymous terms are indicated, they are in our course
written through a slash, "trains": software
/software/application/application/soft. And the fact that each
of these synonyms has slightly different shades of meaning, we will not pay
attention to --- or specifically discuss this difference if it suddenly becomes important and
it is not a terminological difference, but a substantial difference,
a difference of concepts.

Criticism of this approach is also not rare: "How can you teach people,
when you designate the same thing with different words? You must choose one
term, and then use it in the course to designate some concept
only it! That's how it's always done in textbooks!". The answer to this criticism is simple:
in life, you have every chance to meet people who designate concepts
not with the terms introduced in books and courses, including in
our course. So our course will train you to use
different terms for the same concepts: pay attention ---
you are not just being taught new words, not just being made to memorize
terminology. They are trying to give you knowledge about concepts and their connections, under
whatever words-terms these concepts are hidden.

As for the fact that indicating many synonyms slows down the reading of the text, we have
already written: slow reading and thinking about the read improve
the result of learning. If the text is read quickly and smoothly, then it is not certain that
something from this text will be remembered in three days.

We also have gratitude from students in favor of the training method of explicit synonymization
through "train" terms we have adopted. Students usually do not understand in the first half of the course why
it is so complicated to express thoughts through synonymous rows, but somewhere in the second half they gain
experience using the course material in real projects, where
terminology diversity reigns. And then they understand how important it is
to disengage from working with a single "precise term" and the habit
of working with concepts, not terms. Synonymous rows just
develop this habit of understanding the meaning of statements regardless of
the terms used.
