title: 'The Place of Systems Thinking Among Other Thinking Styles: Intelligence Stack'
---

There are differing opinions on whether applied thinking (for example, the thinking of a rocket engineering developer, or teaching people using the pedagogical method of blended learning, or repairing toilets on spaceships) can be considered as thinking. According to one opinion, agents always think, but according to another opinion, thinking is only the function of generating a new applied method with its knowledge/disciplines as potential algorithms for changing the world for situations with a newly encountered problem and tools for these changes, while calculations/reasoning by applied methods no longer require actual thinking, these reasonings run "automatically." The work of a calculator is not called "thinking," it calculates something "hardware-wise," and that's it. According to another opinion (which we adhere to), in situations of applied method (even the work of a calculator, for example, a child painfully multiplying three-digit numbers column-wise on paper), we will still talk about applied thinking. In some given applied field, it is possible to understand well what to do in a typical situation---and do it "automatically," without thinking about the method of work, "not thinking." But in this applied field, there could be many objects, so one will need to:

-   independently develop some method for solving
    (explanations/knowledge/algorithms and tools to support them)
    a specific problematic situation, even without going beyond the specific field (sometimes the development of a method for a specific problematic situation is called strategizing, and the found method is called a strategy),
-   then plan the work (the method is only a way to perform the work, the strategy does not provide a plan with set deadlines and resources), based on available or expected resources (and if resources are insufficient, adjust the method by replacing it with one for which there are enough resources, or provide work for some methods of obtaining the necessary resources), and then only carry out work according to this method-strategy, and also
-   monitor whether the results of the ongoing work satisfy the needs, or if the method needs to be urgently adapted, as either the situation with initial data or required results has changed, or there were errors in previous steps.

Thus, for some elementary operations/actions in the world, thinking seems unnecessary, but thinking is needed to select some explanaied sequence of actions (this is the method) longer, when it is necessary to account for many incoming circumstances, keep attention on a huge number of changing objects at each step of following the method of work---and here we tend to talk about applied thinking, and not just the automatic execution of separate operations. To strike a hammer, that is, just move the muscles with the hammer---it doesn't require much intelligence, but to strike safely, at the right time, in the right place---this already requires thinking, you need to somehow discuss the method of hammer blows, the knowledge/disciplines and the tools of this method.

It is not possible to immediately master applied thinking to solve problems/work difficulties in the work field, let alone combining these various applied thinkings for different methods of work in complex projects involving hundreds of people. But even after mastering narrow applied thinking by one method, it must be acknowledged that without the support of applied knowledge on fundamental/transdisciplinary knowledge, it is not possible to act well in the real world. At the junctions of work by any applied methods, there will be situations not described in any textbook, nor in any work regulation or standard! People are simply obliged to use the fundamental knowledge/explanations of human civilization, because only they allow connecting knowledge of various applied methods and knowledge of work on the civilizational frontier: solving problems for which no one on Earth has yet developed typical solution methods, so these solutions cannot simply be Googled, understood---and then applied without thinking. Although you can ask AI for a problem-solving method, there is no guarantee that this AI will be smart enough to provide something sensible (ask AI today: how to become immortal? There is no guarantee you will get a suitable method description for solving this problem).

If we at least partially know something about the structure of the world, this reduces by several orders of magnitude the number of intelligence calculations/amount of thinking in areas we partially know. Is it a lot? Let's say, we can solve some problem P with the human brain in ten thousand years. This is longer than the existence of human civilization, although you can reduce this time to ten years if a thousand brains work, and you have the resources to support the life of a thousand people, and you know how to effectively organize the division of work among a thousand people. So, it's better to make some non-random, already known civilizational assumptions about the structure of the task and its domain. In our example of problem P, they will allow reducing the calculation volume of one brain by ten thousand times; the task will be solved by one person in a year. This is roughly the difference between the speed of work of uneducated people and educated ones: **uneducated people (savages) know little** **of the general explanations about the** **structure of the world, while the educated ones know a lot. One must learn to quickly solve tasks with** **one's own brain.** **Another option: one must learn to shift this calculation volume onto the brains of other people and computational tools (including AI).**

Civilization with the help of science, relying on the written accumulation of explanations/theories/knowledge/models, gives us hypotheses about the structure of the world ready for study and teaches us to formulate problems (which are unknown how to solve, the subject of intelligence work) and translate them into tasks (which are known how to solve, the subject of applied craftsmanship). These guesses are the basis of education.
**Education is the enhancement of intelligence through training in the** **methods of thinking of** **the intelligence stack.** **Therefore, education is** **the specialization of training (education::training).** Let us remind you: training is a method of creating mastery in performing work by the target method being taught. Education enables faster finding of applied methods to transform a problem into tasks, i.e., translating the situation "I don't know how to approach this" into "I know which method to work to achieve the result---which knowledge and tools to use."

The intellect::mastery acquired during the education process allows solving problems tens of thousands of times faster than this could be done by uneducated homo sapiens' natural innate intellect. A civilized brain is not "wild," it is a trained brain, it is fast in thinking, and the modern brain also uses the brains of other people (collective intellectual work) and computers (classical and with AI programs) to enhance its thinking speed. Moreover, computers can be used in minimal options not due to computer calculations, but simply through the help in organizing memory and keeping attention. The computer as "pen-paper" is also extremely effective for thinking! An intelligent and lazy educated person with a laptop can do much more than a crowd of active but uneducated fools-savages!

The acquisition of new mastery does not come to a person through "natural ingenuity," but through "refined by education ingenuity," through knowledge/models/explanations/theories/disciplines about the world's structure, the structure of problems and tasks, and also knowledge/explanations/disciplines about available tools (for example, computers as universal modelers for systemic modeling of all sorts of objects).

The same applies to AI. Computers made at the factory for AI are dumb; they can perform only the simplest operations like matrix multiplication. But after learning from a huge amount of knowledge already accumulated in written form by civilization, these computers acquire the mastery of reasoning based on this knowledge, "large language models/LLMs," otherwise known as "foundation models," referring precisely to their transdisciplinary nature. This is akin to "education": training in thinking and some engineering horizons. And then such fundamental models are easily either fine-tuned to applied knowledge or connected to such models in the form of tools (say, connecting Wolfram Mathematica for solving mathematical tasks).

Skill and mastery are references to an agent mastering the execution of work by some method based on theory/knowledge/explanation/algorithm/discipline, with the execution of this method/work supported by some tools. Intelligence is the mastery of fundamental thinking methods required for discussing methods in conditions when it is not clear which method to apply (possibly, such a method does not exist yet---or there are no knowledge or tools, they still need to be created).

Intellect::mastery works with applied methods (and thereby their knowledge/disciplines/algorithms/theories) as objects of its work. One can say that intellect as a fundamental thinking mastery creates and further develops applied methods, it is necessary for cognition, for the infinite growth of knowledge (knowledge evolution) and tools to support working with these infinitely growing knowledge. More knowledge and supporting tools---more translation of various problems into tasks. Infectious diseases were a problem, but knowledge about microbes and soap as a tool with the method of hygienic handwashing significantly solved these problems; combating infections became a set of tasks, not a problem: it is known what to do, one only needs to find resources and then just do it.

Intelligence in its innate part allows people to be smarter than cats and monkeys, and in its learned/educated part---this is an education-received machine for acquiring applied disciplines. Intelligence is an evolutionary acquired tool of cognition, a machine for developing problem-solving methods---transforming problems that are not solved by any known methods into tasks performed/solved by known applied methods. This applies to natural intelligence, artificial, hybrid, and collective.

**Trans-disciplines/“fundamental disciplines” are** **explanations/theories/knowledge/models/algorithms about the structure of the world. They are convenient for high-speed thinking about the world, keeping** **attention on** **calculations/reasoning/thinking** **about the important, preserving** **brain or computer resources** **from wasting on thinking** **about the unimportant.** And this thinking by trans-disciplines' knowledge/algorithms is then needed to create methods for changing the world for the better.

What takes a very ingenious savage half a life time, a person trained in fundamental disciplines can accomplish in a few hours or even seconds---especially, if considering that the knowledge/algorithms of thinking methods include knowledge on exploiting other tools of thinking (often these are modelers). The same applies to computers with AI; only these computers do not have biological constraints on computing speed and volume for one agent, which is why they are feared about as much as genius villain scientists are feared in Hollywood movies.

Intelligence is the mastery of agile use of a whole stack/stack/layer cake of supporting each other fundamental methods of thinking. This set of thinking methods (relying on engaging fundamental disciplines and using support tools) is what we call **intelligence stack.**

In fundamental **methods** of thinking, the disciplines/theories/knowledge will be only the "algorithmic" part. We will boldly consider these disciplines/theories/knowledge also as "algorithms" (descriptions of using the method in various circumstances/situations---just as algorithms can be used for calculations with various inputs):

-   There are many indications that constructive mathematics is in fact a transition from declarative (objects and relations) descriptions to descriptions through operations for constructing objects. This can be extended to all working with concepts (mental/mathematical objects).
-   In computer science, results have long been obtained that allow considering the most different representations of algorithms, and not only "step-by-step execution of imperative programs" (including the Curry-Howard correspondence between imperative algorithm and set of logical statements). We interpret this result quite broadly.
-   We should consider not the knowledge itself, but what the processor does with it---in this case, the mastery of executing a method using knowledge for computing (thinking) or even altering the world (thinking and using tools). In Constructor theory, there is a generalization of the concept of an algorithm to describe transformations not only information and superinformation (in quantum computers, represented not in bits, but qubits), but theoretically any physical transformations.

Thinking methods, like any other methods, use not only concepts from theories/knowledge/explanations/algorithms/disciplines (including trans-disciplines), but also **tools,** understood as a set of tools/apparatus/equipment that extends the agent's body's capabilities. In the case of trans-disciplines of thinking, the tool is usually a **modeler** (simplest one is pen-paper, or a modeler program for a computer), and the consumable material for the modeler is coffee for the human-modeler and electricity for the computer embodying the model. Other tools in fundamental thinking methods of the intelligence stack are rare, though they occur. For example, in the conceptualization, the body is used, sensations are sought that later need to be translated into thought, the role of the conceptualization executor---"the poet."

Despite the practical nature of thinking, intelligence needs more to model the world, i.e., to engage in cognition/learning, creating models, rather than directly changing it in action—but remember that these models are needed precisely for changing oneself and the world for the better. Intelligence decides in case of difficulties whether to change the model of the world, the model of oneself, oneself or the world---and dependently.

Overall, cognition ultimately occurs through trials and errors, i.e., not only by verbalizing "mental" guesses-explanations and mentally criticizing them but by actively probing the physical world, making guesses and observing the results---whether successful or not. This applies even to the boundary between the agent itself and the environment---what can be simply commanded, what can be significantly influenced, what can be influenced insignificantly, and what cannot be influenced yet. The agent continuously does something to the surrounding environment to understand the boundaries of their influence---and changing the environment for the better (for themselves, for their genes, for the population---this is a separate question).

In the transition to applied engineering (as changing the world) via the "trial and error" method in the old and well-known field to this agent or even a new little-known field, the agent engages a variety of the most different tools and applies the most different initial materials: machines, chemical reagents, trained animals, sunlight, pond water, clocks, ballet barre, quantum computer, etc.

There is some cunning in thinking by fundamental methods being purely a "mental act." Input-output in the processor (e.g., the brain in humans) is quite material and requires tools/equipment (printing, online courses, messengers for receiving problems and sending solutions), and the processor itself is quite a physical object. As David Deutsch loves to remind, a mathematician and astrophysicist---quite physical objects, "mental labor" requires physical labor! In the course, we use the concept of "constructor," which is a generalization of a computer capable of executing a computing algorithm to a constructor system from constructor theory, which can execute knowledge/algorithm method as an "algorithm for changing the physical environment."

The method of work executed by the constructor includes a knowledge part (which is software-hardware implemented in the constructor by the mastery of executing methods' algorithms/explanations/theories) and a hardware part (mastery in supporting it with the body of the agent can also be attributed to this hardware part, and further goes tools as sensors and actuators, and also “exotella” as a platform for all these sensors and actuators, that is, equipment/tools that help the mastery do additional calculations and actions by measurements in the physical world and changes in the physical world). For universal constructors (intelligent agents), one can talk not just about computations, but immediately about thinking, and also consider situations when, during the method execution, the constructor first builds additional tools---bootstrap.

Constructor theory generalizes the concepts of

-   algorithm (the term remains the same) as descriptions/theories/disciplines,
-   measurement (input, physical interaction to obtain data)
-   change (processing in case of information, in case of substance---transformation)
-   output (in the case of constructors, this operation is not separately considered, included in transformation)

So, we can further discuss transformations not only of information but also of physical objects, and also the concept of **computer,** implementing "information processing by some algorithm" method, expanding to the concept of constructor, implementing "transformation of the physical world by some algorithm" method.

A universal computer with enough computing resources (memory and time) can fundamentally perform any computation that a Turing machine can (known computing theory), while a universal constructor with bootstrapping (for example, starting with smelting metal from ore, obtaining pure silicon for a semiconductor from sand) fundamentally with enough resources (memory, time, initial set of tools) can perform any transformation of substance--and "any" is understood as in mathematics, referring to theoretical possibility. Practical possibility will be limited by resources and the risks of some catastrophe (say, an asteroid flies in and destroys the constructor which has all necessary resources---and it does not have time to complete its work.)

It is particularly emphasized that a constructor is capable of performing multiple calculations by one method (algorithm/theory/explanations/knowledge and apparatus/tools), remaining unchanged---just as a molecule of a catalyst (a simple constructor) can perform multiple acts of catalysis, remaining unchanged.
