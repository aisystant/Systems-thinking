title: Does Systems Thinking Replace Applied Thinking?
---

One of the misconceptions is that you can have strong general intelligence, including the development of systems thinking—and significantly outperform professionals in their specific fields. To put it bluntly, you become very smart, and then you'll have an advantage over, say, a less intelligent pianist or even a welder. Unfortunately, this doesn't work. A person with systems thinking will have an advantage over a professional in how quickly they understand the overall project, how swiftly they come to an agreement with other project participants, how well they can stay focused on the main tasks of the project, and not get distracted by less important things during the work. They will also be able to learn something quickly. But they won't have an immediate advantage in solving practical tasks! No systems thinking will help you instantly start playing the violin, or using a welding machine, or even diagnosing patients if you've never done any of it before. Not immediately—yes, you will learn all this faster, but simply becoming smart and believing that this gives you an advantage in some applied discipline over a professional in that discipline is a mistake. If you become a professional in this applied discipline, you will be more of a professional than your less intelligent colleague. But if you don't become a professional—you will be "generally smart," "eternally promising."

Moreover, errors in systems thinking can arise from ignoring various transdisciplinary intelligence stack fields. If you have a good understanding of how to build a hierarchy in terms of composition, but poorly understand the classification relation, your systems thinking won't help; you'll make thinking errors for other reasons, and you'll need to get more into ontology (for example, to retake the "Rational Work" course, which is a prerequisite for our systems thinking course).

**Systems thinking does not replace applied/subject-specific thinking,**
**nor does it guarantee good thinking across all fundamental**
**thinking methods of the intelligence stack. For instance,** **systems thinking**
**does not guarantee rationality: it's not a fact that** **if you think systemically, then** **you** **will**
**necessarily** **make good decisions, utilizing modern decision theory!**

To see the error in "2\*2=5," you still need to know arithmetic; no systems thinking will help here. If you don't know how to repair a toilet, and you need to, a systems thinking course won't help you, a plumbing textbook will. However, systems thinking enhances, guides, and complements applied thinking, as well as thinking within the framework of fundamental methods. For example, systems thinking will help you choose the modern/best plumbing textbook from many available, understand the overall situation of toilet repair. Maybe the toilet doesn't need repair at all, and the problem lies elsewhere: the toilet here is a "symptom," not the "disease"! But fundamental systems thinking does not replace practical plumbing thinking. You will still have to get educated in the engineering of toilet systems, master the applied engineering method/culture/practice of this work, i.e., acquire plumbing knowledge as an educational discipline/explanations, including knowledge of using the tools there (for example, knowing how to use an adjustable wrench, a cable with a brush to clean pipes, push rods with various attachments for different types of clogs).

If you plan to solve problems in some applied subject area without knowing the state-of-the-art (best known knowledge today) methods of work in this subject area, relying only on wit and ingenuity, we call this tinkering^[Here are some examples of tinkering: <https://vk.com/club45696675>].
Tinkering is folk inventiveness, without relying on modern methods of work with their contemporary knowledge and the use of modern tools. Tinkering is like folk healing, but in engineering.

Sometimes tinkering works and gives a "working system," but such a system cannot be marketed widely. A "working system" as a result of tinkering is not necessarily the best in its class in terms of characteristics, reliability, cost-effective operation, and ready for mass production. You cannot ignore the achievements of human culture, thinking that "creativity" is when you invent everything yourself. The point is, quality creativity should be inherently better than existing options. Hence, it's necessary at least to know about existing engineering ideas to compare your inventions with those already in the culture.

You should at least google applied knowledge/explanations, ask intellectual assistants and co-pilots about it. Even better—master the applied method from a textbook, even more reliably—complete training courses on the applied method. A professional is someone who does not make novice mistakes (knows about them!), not someone who just knows a lot^[This definition is attributed to Niels Bohr.].

It's bad to always act by trial and error, relying on "freedom of creativity" and saying, "there's no time to explore the issue, no time to study, work has to be done." "To invent something on the go" is exactly trying, hoping it works out, such a techno-evolution method is ultimately very costly unless you have millions of years like natural evolution does. Of course, the trial and error method is used in engineering, it is recognized in engineering, but it is not the main one. If the tinkering method were the main one, engineers wouldn't need education.

**A systems thinker is not one who ignores textbooks, standards,
or regulations on applied work methods.** **On the contrary: it's someone who can quickly choose the necessary textbook** **or find the modern work standard, understand its**
**contents, and take into account the peculiarities of the current situation using all other applied** **work methods** **in a complex team project.
Systems thinking aids applied thinking,** **not replaces it.**
