**Reasonableness** (a characteristic of intellect showing how capable a person is of changing their behavior after accepting rational arguments) is better in humans than in cats. It's better in cats than in ants. You can explain something once to humans, but you have to train a cat with repetitions to achieve the desired behavior. You can't even train ants.

But no matter how reasonable people are, life shows that you can't teach someone to ride a bicycle or drive a car with explanations alone, nor can you teach them to do something complex. For example, you can't teach mathematics with explanations alone. You need to solve problems and do exercises. Just reading a math textbook won't help. Repeated actions with the textbook material are required, keeping the brain engaged in reflections on the textbook's topics.

To master a certain cultural way of thinking (according to the best samples and styles, not just by chance), exercises and repeated mental operations are needed. A neural network learns from a large number of repetitions.

This also applies to mental operations of focusing on important objects. In our course, these important objects will be various systems that need to be learned to recognize, identify their boundaries, specify their type, find the relationships between them, and be able to describe them and their behavior, and recognize their states.

Since we need to keep the student's attention on the course materials for at least the minimally necessary time to at least somewhat reliably train the neural network of their brain, these materials do not represent a well-structured handbook, the result of the work of a scholar-methodologist. No, these course materials primarily represent the work of a methodologist as a specialist in training agents, primarily humans. The "wet" neural network in humans learns through multiple repetitions of the learning materials, preferably in different contexts. This abundance of repetitions is exactly what you see in the course. The course material swells up---but it teaches, unlike the single presentation of the "exact definition from the textbook," which doesn’t work in terms of providing definitions (there is a special subsection in the course about the harm of definitions) and learning. From a single presentation of any idea in a short fragment, there is no training of the neural network, including learning after which it would be possible to perform any working tasks---the material needed for these tasks is simply not remembered, and the teacher-human or teacher-AI who would point the student to the forgotten short fragment may not be present.

In our course, the main thing is a set of assignments for the student in textual (writing posts) and tabular (filling in tables with prescribed columns) modeling. In fact, the student spends most of their time not with the “textbook” and its attached “workbook,” but rather with the modeler for work projects (writes posts and fills in tables in assignments), to which the “textbook” is attached as “contextual help” for this modeler. For every hour spent working with the modeler, there might be just ten minutes of reading the “textbook.” So reading the “textbook” might be just one-sixth of the time spent on the “course.”

If you skim through the textbook (three times faster than reading it carefully)---you’ve mastered one-eighteenth of the course material. If you read carefully without doing assignments, you’ve mastered one-sixth of the course. Of course, hoping to master systems thinking without doing assignments is impossible.

As an example, let's repeat what was just said about the necessity of repetitions in different contexts, rephrasing slightly. The main thing in the course in terms of teaching methodology:

- Keep the "wet neural network" of a human-student (that is, you) focused on the concepts of systems thinking for enough time to give the neural network the time needed for learning. Teacher's work can be automated, student's work cannot, as training any neural network requires a large number of operations with a set of concepts.
- The course material should be repeated in various contexts to be effectively absorbed. This means that re-reading a piece of text five times is useless, so is modeling the same object five times in the same way. The ideas of a text piece need to be read five times in other pieces of text, just as a set of concepts needs to be modeled five different ways for the repetitions to be useful.
- To overcome natural forgetting, training needs to be repeated multiple times, not consecutively but with intervals.

The course uses methodological techniques that may surprise a student unfamiliar with them, accustomed to manuals and scientific literature. No, our course materials are educational, they:

- Use principles of "spacing" and "interleaving." The text intentionally revisits topics at different intervals (spacing), and simultaneously discusses a mix of three to four topics (interleaving) instead of presenting them in strict sequence. Sequential presentation of topics or grouping of several examples on one topic (blocking) as usually done in reference literature is intentionally absent! The course isn’t a reference book! If you need a reference, you can ask an AI, which will provide a reference from the course material. Students (and if they are children, their parents) intuitively believe that an orderly, compact presentation of material on one topic (blocking) is easier to perceive and better for subsequent recall. But this is a misconception: **experiments show that interleaving and spacing hinder learning because they are harder to perceive but significantly improve learning outcomes**.
- Some text fragments are repeated in different parts of the course, sometimes after a couple of paragraphs, sometimes after dozens of pages, and sometimes after hundreds of pages. And this happens not just once---some ideas are repeated dozens of times! These repetitions are intentional, considering the necessity of repetition for training the student's neural network, as the human brain does not remember everything from the first presentation. Our course usually takes a month and a half, and by the end of studying the last sections, the content of the initial sections has already been forgotten, described by **forgetting curves**. We understand that not everyone will repeat the course for review, so we have simply embedded some repetitions within a single read-through. But we’re confident that it’s still **extremely beneficial to go through this course a second time, even not just this course but the entire chain of courses in the "Organizational Development" program of SHSM**. Why go through the entire chain? Because each subsequent course in the sequence will add understanding of the previous courses' material. If there is difficulty understanding some section, it’s useless to repeatedly read it (of course, if you read it slowly and attentively, not just skimming), just move on: there will likely be an explanation in a few pages, and if you reach the end, the explanation might be in the next course.
- The issue isn’t that the text of our course contains few repetitions. It’s that the understanding during the second pass through the entire course chain will be completely different! **Experience shows that the second time the course feels like the first: completely different understanding and reading.** However, our course does not differ from any other complex texts. Each complex text conveys a complexly connected graph of concepts. When sequentially describing a graph, "forward references" to not yet well-understood concepts are inevitable. Hence, only a double pass is an option: the first time you get acquainted with the concepts, the second time you understand all the connections between familiar concepts. Describing connections between poorly understood concepts is useless: they will be ignored and forgotten.
- The terminology for the main course concepts is deliberately not fixed: synonymous series/"trains" are explicitly used everywhere. You won’t be able to quickly skim through a phrase to understand it! Your eyes will be tripped up by a long synonymous series. Method/practice/ practice/activity/style/culture/type of work---such synonyms will be encountered throughout the text. Each time you need to consciously understand which concept is meant by this list. This is also deliberately done in the course. **In life, you won’t encounter the words from the course (you don’t encounter "physical bodies" in life, although the physics textbook talks about them), and the course doesn’t contain life words (the physics textbook doesn’t describe the flight of an empty bottle to the trash can but describes the flight of a physical body to an unknown destination).** Our course prepares for this situation: assigning types from the course to life objects is done based on conceptual similarity (mental models behind used words-terms), not word similarity! Reading the course text becomes slower and more conscious, but that’s good: your brain’s neural network benefits from it! Using a slash for synonymous series is quite common in engineering and English texts, only in literary Russian texts is it unapproved but we ignore this in our case.

**Learning turns out to be the rare case where** **"spacing," "dispersion," "repetition"** **and unfixed terminology are beneficial** **for the result. Of course,** **they increase the time for** **learning, but we perceive this as beneficial: "increase the time the brain works with the course concepts." This is beneficial time increase, it's the goal! We need to keep your neural network engaged with the course concepts, the result in establishing systems thinking will be improved.**

In the systems thinking course (this isn’t in the book, so we highly recommend taking the course in Aisystant instead of just reading the book) you will need to

- Answer questions and provide explanations for these answers,
- Engage in table modeling,
- Complete assignments by recording your thoughts on the results in posts.

Don’t be lazy in providing explanations for answering questions: this will help improve your fluency with the terminology. Instead of vague feelings of correctness or incorrectness, "mumbling in the mind" (like "uhhh" in the mind as a guess about an answer will remain nameless, though the goal of answering questions is to master the terminology and remember arguments), you will have to articulate your reasoning on the correctness of the answer in some text, and terms will no longer "be on the tip of the tongue" but not remembered and thus not learned after taking the course. This learning practice of writing explanations for answers to questions will be useful when you interact with colleagues in a work situation in a month or two. Because you can’t tell a colleague an argument in the form of "uhhh, I feel the answer is this, but I can’t remember why." Arguments should be clear and expressed in words, not "uhhh" in your head. You will probably need to look at the textbook text to remember the argument, recall the terms, and write the explanation.

Here’s a typical student review:

Yes, it seems the real game changer is the exercises.

I remember reading the 2015 text in a half-trance, understanding about 20% (not understanding why I needed it all), just downloading it with one click somewhere. It was tough to wade through it, of course. When I read the new version (last year), I suffered from how long, diluted, and repetitive everything was. Recall of information in both cases I evaluate as the same. Only the course with exercises really cleared the mush in my head.

"Only the course with exercises really cleared the mush in my head" is what everyone says after doing the exercises. But only one in ten taking the course attempts the exercises. We hope you are that one person. If you don’t do the exercises, don’t work on the assignments, you'll keep the mush in your head, there will be no benefit from "reading the course" (rather than "taking the course", which implies doing the assignments).

To assimilate the material, we don’t advise writing summaries/the exposition of the textbook course material or using underlining of individual phrases---these are student legends about how to learn, but many experiments have shown this is useless and doesn’t improve material assimilation. We advise you to write short texts about all the new thoughts that came to you during the course, in the genre of "essay," not "exposition/crib." It greatly helps learning to publish these notes, for example, in our club. A social media account would also work, although it would be harder to get interesting comments there, but even those comments aren’t that essential. Your own thoughts, your own models coming to mind during the course, are important, don’t lose them. Search for words to describe them, write them down, not so much to share with the world but to keep your neural network engaged with the course material longer. For training the neural network (whether it’s a human neural network or implemented by silicon or even quantum computer), it requires time working with material that includes these concepts. This educational strategy of thinking through writing/modeling is time-tested and highly effective. Again, you write not for an external audience, but for yourself: it's time to keep your neural network engaged in thinking about the course material.
