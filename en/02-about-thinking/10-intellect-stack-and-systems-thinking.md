title: Intellect Stack and Systems Thinking
---

At the top of the stack of fundamental thinking methods, the very
"trans" transition occurs: fundamental/transdisciplinary methods of the
intellect stack help in thinking and acting with applied engineering
methods to change the world.

**Systems thinking** can be understood as mental techniques of several
methods of the intellect stack as disciplines/theories/explanations/knowledge,
supported by tools, primarily by modeling tools. These systems thinking techniques engage
the concepts of "system," "system level," "emergence,"
"disarray," and other concepts of the **system approach**. One could
say not just "systems thinking," but also "ontological systems thinking," because systems thinking is based on the transdiscipline of ontology,
and "methodological systems thinking," because the principles of the transdiscipline of methodology are substantially engaged, and "labor systems thinking,"
and "activity-based systems thinking," and "engineering systems thinking,"
"rational systems thinking," and so on.

Systems engineering --- is engineering, whose method descriptions are based
on systems thinking. But one could simply say "engineering,"
the systemacity of modern engineering thinking would not be reduced by this. One
could add ontology to this title: "ontological systems
engineering," as they sometimes say --- ontology based systems
engineering^[<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166361518307887>].
You could add ethics, "ethical systems engineering." Or
rationality, "rational systems engineering."

Systems thinking, as part of the intellect's overall thinking (thinking according
to all the methods of the intellect stack in their entirety) does not turn off in the course
of applied method/“type of work”/activity/engineering/practice/strategy tasks. Systems thinking ---
is part of fundamental thinking, which will always be engaged
when something in life is encountered that is not described in the
textbook/regulation/instruction/standard of the applied method and its
discipline/theory/model/knowledge/explanations, for example, in a management
textbook, a medicine textbook, a law textbook.

The mere comparison of the textbook content (regulation, standard) on
the applied method of thinking with life already requires the
engagement of fundamental thinking. For example, in the regulation ("employee's manual"),
there will be a statement: "Loans are not issued to underage clients.” To understand this phrase, you need to think hard:

-   What is "underage," if a foreigner has come and in his
    country a different age of majority is accepted --- are you infringing on his
    rights?
-   What is a "client," if the person is in the middle of processing their
    client status?
-   What is a "loan" out of a dozen very similar-looking banking
    products, and some of them are "borrowings"?
-   What is "loan issuance" and at what point can it be considered that it has
    occurred or not occurred?
-   This was all a translation of the initial phrase from Tamil: how to ensure
    the translation was accurate?

And now try to explain this not even to yourself, but to a dumb computer,
which needs to implement this organizational norm/business
rule^[<https://ailev.livejournal.com/693597.html>].
It will not be possible to explain this to a programmer, because these are not
questions of information technology, these are not issues of his specialty "software
engineering."

And ontological thinking does not disappear when systems thinking is in
progress, there are pieces of ontology in the very systems thinking. For example,
how we consider that differently sectioned parts of an object are
indeed the same object --- is a traditional question of ontology.
For example, scissors consisting of two halves and a screw at the factory, and scissors composed
of a blade block and a handle during their operation --- are the same scissors, because these two different objects occupy the same place in
space-time. This explicitly mentions the principle of 4D extensionalism,
you should know it from the course "Rational Work." Let us remind you that for
the course "Systems Thinking," satisfactory completion of the course "Rational
Work" is a mandatory prerequisite.

Focused attention as attention management does not turn off, when ontological thinking takes place, you are writing everything down, and not just "mentally focused, remembering everything"! All these thinking methods (the intellect stack and even the applied thinking of applied skills) run practically
simultaneously in close intertwining, and only our (often supported
by computers and well-trained) attention can highlight in this
coherent and continuous process of intellect thinking certain
moments associated with different specific kinds of thinking conducted
by specific types of skills.

This simultaneous consideration of very different methods of thinking as reasoning with
very different objects of attention is quite easy to understand: when you
look at a tree swaying in the wind, discussing the angles of swaying
depending on the strength of the wind, but this absolutely does not exclude that in
this tree right at the same moment during the discussion photosynthesis continues, and in the hollow of this tree unknown birds are hatching chicks.
No, all of this is present in the real world. It's just that when your attention
is focused on the image of the swaying tree as a whole, you can examine in detail
specifically the object "swaying tree as a whole," but objects of other sizes,
included in the physical object "swaying tree as a whole" and surrounding this
physical object, will not be examined. But they do not disappear from life, just
temporarily (and sometimes forever) remain hidden from you.
Temporarily hidden until you pay attention specifically to them. Forever
hidden, if your attention never turns to them.

But now you have paid attention to photosynthesis, while the swaying
tree in the strong wind, and what is in the tree's hollow — all of that instantly
lost value, the attention is switched to photosynthesis and we
hold attention on photosynthesis, engaging focus. But
"disappearance of objects in consideration" is solely the work of our
attention, nothing happens to the tree! In life, the tree exists in
its entirety, neither photosynthesis, nor the bird, nor
the swaying in the wind, go away. It is just convenient for us to consider and discuss all
these things sequentially, not all at once. And we are active during this: deciding
whether to consider this tree at all (and not a bicycle), maybe even
to approach the tree, or to simply reproduce its model right "in the head,"
without doing anything with the body at this time (not forgetting that
"thinking/reasoning/calculating" is also body work, whether human, or robot).

This reasoning about highlighting different **whole**
**objects** **with one focus of attention, and** **tracking**
**parts** **of these whole objects** **with other foci of attention for
the convenience of considering complex situations, and then reliably holding these **whole** **objects** **and their** **parts in attention without wandering from these different focal points
(use of focus to work with parts and wholes of these parts) — this is typical for systems thinking, this is the very essence of the approach,
which is why systems thinking was developed, although you can safely
consider this to be some synthesis from conceptualization (highlighting objects, naming them, to then distinguish and talk about them) and focus
(holding in attention), physics (highlighting parts in isolation from
the surrounding world), concept theory (part-whole relation), ontology
(understanding hierarchy in part-whole relations as a basis for highlighting
system levels).

You choose the right **part-whole level** **of consideration for solving your tasks
(scale of size in lengths, scale of time in durations,
** "organization level," "evolutionary level," "techno-evolutionary level," "system level" — ** for living
systems, to be crude, molecules, cells, organs, organisms, populations, and
similarly “by size” attention will slice it for techno-systems).
Then you solve your problems at the chosen level of part-whole consideration, directing attention up or down these
levels depending on what you are reasoning.

If something is not discussed in enough detail, you can always come back and
discuss it further (and to avoid losing attention, we write everything down, not
just reason "inside the head"). **We discuss parts, without losing sight of the whole. We discuss the whole, without forgetting the parts.** Discussion engages
our attention to some level of the parts of the whole object, and then
to parts of those parts. The object itself remains in its natural wholeness, and
parts and whole objects on many levels are highlighted only by attention.
Attention can work in the opposite direction: for some parts
of the whole object, it can be directed further "up" by system levels, that is, to the whole object. And then this whole object can be declared a part, and the attention will find an encompassing whole of an even higher system level.

The intellect stack as a set of thinking methods cannot be regarded as a classical
system from physics (methods are behavior, the system could be attempted to be called the thinking object itself, that is the intellect, although there are nuances), but the work of attention to individual thinking methods, and in the very
methods of the intellect stack attention to concepts of individual transdisciplines and supporting them separate reasoning support instruments by the
thinking techniques of these transdisciplines (mainly modelers)
are arranged similarly: from a dense unbroken tangle of concepts and their relations
we highlight with attention, and then hold in attention and discuss in detail
individual thinking methods, and within them disciplines and tools, and further
dismember attention methods into individual thinking techniques, and even individual parts of these techniques (with all the uncertainty
of the conversation about "parts of operations/techniques/procedures," although we will explain further in the course how to try to sort out behavior/activity/behavior to more precisely draw boundaries between different behaviors).

Thinking is inseparable in its fundamental and applied methods, it
occurs as a whole and applied, and general labor/engineering, and
intuitive-conceptual (conceptualization deals with this), and algorithmic, and
ontological, and methodological, in it are present all applied
thinking methods and all fundamental thinking methods of the intellect stack.

If we reflect on thinking itself (the intellect stack is just for this!),
we highlight by the power of our attention in thinking methods certain parts and
for some time think only about them to overcome the
complexity of thinking, to better understand how thinking is arranged, how to
teach it. **Some** **attentively highlighted parts** **of full thinking** **on knowledge** **from various** **methods of the
intellect stack,** **dealing with concepts like "system," "system
level," "emergence" and other concepts of the system approach —**
**that will be** **systems thinking.** **The course of systems thinking you are now taking was created to teach these parts of
full fundamental thinking from the entire intellect stack.**

Similarly to how rational, semantic, logical, etc.
thinking uses in their composition techniques of systems thinking based on
the concepts of the system approach, so rational, semantic,
logical, ontological, and many other fundamental thinking methods are engaged in systems thinking: concepts of theories/disciplines
of fundamental thinking methods are strongly interwoven with each other. Without mastering the thinking methods of the full intellect stack, you will not become
a good systems thinker.

**One** **course of systems thinking** **is not enough to think systems-wise. The systems thinking course gives** **only one slice, one** **sampling** **from all the knowledge needed for** **full-fledged** **intellect enhancement. Students** **in universities** **often fail the** **systems thinking** **course** **not because of ignorance of system approach concepts and inability** **to use them in thinking about
their work projects,** **but due to poor preparation** **in areas of
semantics, concept theory, ontology, logic**^[<https://ailev.livejournal.com/1465753.html>].

For instance, consider a discipline/theory like semantics: a typical
mistake when it is unknown — is the failure to distinguish between a concept and its term. As soon as you relax — in systems thinking, the concept “needs” as a psychological need
to drink-eat-reproduce, and “needs” as the interest of external project
roles to their systems (super-systems for target or creation systems in their chains) are already confused. The word-term is one, the dictionary nests are different, the concepts
are different — but this is often not tracked, terms and concepts are not
distinguished, because there is no knowledge in semantics. In the systems thinking course,
there is no opportunity to explain semantics in detail, it is already used here! Courses teaching
semantics need to be completed before the systems thinking course!

For example, the "Rational Work" course is arranged roughly similarly to the systems
thinking course: knowledge/theories from various thinking methods of the intellect stack are taken,
but the emphasis is different: on focus, semantics, concept theory, ontology, logic. Concepts of systems thinking are touched upon in the "Rational Work" course,
but they are not the focal point, there is no detailed exposition. Therefore, only the "Rational Work" course is also not sufficient to enhance one's intellect, just like only the "Systems Thinking" course or only the "Methodology" course.

Another example: the inability of an agent to work with types in thinking. Methods
of this work with types are described by concept theory knowledge, one of
the transdisciplines of the intellect stack's methods. If you write, "System
X — is a system of relations between buyers and sellers," then you cannot
after three lines write that "System X — is a software platform,"
and after three more lines that "System X — is a project for
providing service." This is the same kind of mistake as writing "X —
is a cucumber," three lines later writing "X — is a fur-bearing animal," and three lines later
writing "X — is a system of values." The type of error here is the same, but for
cucumber and fur-bearing animal common sense is enough
to notice the mistake, but that the "system of relations" is nowhere near
a "software platform," and a "platform" — is not a "project" — this
is already an insurmountable task for a poorly trained person in type work. If you see this in a student's text, you clearly understand that
the concept of the target system as a physical object is not in the student’s mind, but
there is a sort of "cloud of meanings," not brought to some
physical implementation.

Working with types also concerns the capability to conduct reasoning about
objects from the textbook on objects from life. If you understand that your
type "physical body" in the physics textbook flies along a parabola when thrown in the presence of gravity, this is reasoning about types. In life, you still have to figure out that the thrown ball is precisely that physical body from the textbook! Further, you need to refer to the physics textbook material and take
from there that the flight will be along a parabola. Then return to the ball and deliver
the judgment that "since the ball is a physical body, it will fly
along a parabola," and even estimate what place abstract objects
"parabola" and "trajectory" have around the ball in the real world. This reasoning is the same as about some target systems. If you
produce "accounting systems," then you still need to realize that
the word "system" here — is a type from the theory/knowledge of the systems approach,
refer to the material of our course, then find this system in
the surrounding world (what kind of "system" is this? Is it a type for a set of accounting rules?
But you clearly do not produce them, and they do not resemble systems from the course. Moreover, the course clearly says that sets of rules and system equations —
these are not the "systems" of the systems approach. Further question: Is it
software? Is it the "accounting" department that uses the accounting software? This
department, which uses the software and all the people who are forced
to supply data to the department, which feeds this data into the software? At what
moment in time can you say that "we have released the accounting system?" Why do different people in the
company disagree on what we are releasing?).
**This is all about type operations** — **if this is not figured out, it is impossible to find important objects of attention in life, a lot of which will be known immediately as soon as you identify them with
objects from our course.** **The course does not give knowledge about specific systems
in specific projects. But the course gives knowledge about all the systems in all
projects. You just need to know how to assign types from the course to objects from the real
world, from your real work project.**

Particularly here, one can mention poor handling with verbal
nouns (thinking here can also serve as an example). Thinking
once can be a process (and in our course it is just that), implemented
by the intellect/computational thinking/cognitive skill, and the second time among the same people and sometimes in the same phrase — is a part of the brain,
a synonym for intellect, not its behavior (and in our course it is not that)! And that thinking as a "verb" and thinking as a "noun" can be confused — people
with poor training in concept theory do not notice. They will have everything very, very bad
with the concept of a system because functions in the concept of a system are assigned
precisely by verbal nouns, and these are behaviors, not things, and confusion here is inadmissible.
All these questions that are not covered by the systems thinking course but are addressed in other courses on intellect enhancement, primarily in the "Rational Work" course.

Here you can also add overgeneralizations, this also concerns
working with types as ontological work. Instead of some object, it is very poor to indicate its super-super-super-type/class, very high
standing in the classifier, and count on everything taken from inheriting the type properties. For example, instead of "tiger" always
assuming "beast" — and then being surprised why other people insert in the conversation their "mouse" (this is also a beast!), after which the phrase "mouse is dangerous for humans" surprises them and they do not understand where it comes from. And such a phrase appears because
a "tiger" should be called a tiger, not a more general class "beast." Overgeneralizing
is unnecessary, excessive generalizations often lead to errors! If you
point out a drill as "equipment" and give it a characteristic "rotation frequency," that seems normal.
But then someone adds such "equipment" as a hatch, and the hatch gets the characteristic
"rotation frequency"! This is a simple logical consequence of "hatch —
is equipment." Because you were thinking of a "drill," but wrote "equipment"!

Another logical obstacle for systems thinking as
concept usage of the
