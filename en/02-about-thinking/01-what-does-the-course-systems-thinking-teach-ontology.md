title: 'What the Course "Systems Thinking" Teaches: Ontology'
---

Humanity has broken free from the realm of nature. Today, the mass of humans is 300 million tons. This is twice the mass of all large vertebrates that lived on Earth before human civilization appeared. The mass of material processed by humans is estimated at 30 trillion tons, which is more than 50 kg per square meter of the Earth's surface^[Zalasiewicz et al., “Scale and diversity of the physical technosphere”, Zalasiewicz et al., <http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053019616677743>]. And this is a consequence of the fact that people in humanity over the last couple of thousand years have enhanced their intelligence and accumulated a critical mass of explanations, allowing them to effectively "escape" from various external threats.

**In the first three subsections of the course, we will provide** **a small** **ontology (objects and relationships), which** **will help to discuss** **the place of systems thinking in overall thinking.** **It will be said many times in the course that relying on exact definitions is** **only in mathematics. But several subsections will resemble "issuing definitions"; reading will be somewhat like reading dictionary/glossary entries.**

**We do not expect you to understand everything in this small ontology right now, just like in mathematics—** **complete understanding will come later, the main thing here is not to get stuck on each subsection and to persistently move forward in the courses (we will repeat and explain each concept in them, give examples, and show mistakes in their use).**

**All these concepts are expanded upon** **not even in our course "Systems Thinking", but** **in the courses following** **"Systems Thinking"** **(primarily courses like "Methodology", "Personality Engineering", "Intellect-Stack").** **Nevertheless, to understand the place of systems thinking among other types of thinking, we need to figure out what thinking is—** **although, as mentioned, we do not expect that you will understand this from the texts of the first three sections. Just continue with the course, understanding will come!**

**At the MechMath department of MSU, there's a saying among lecturers: "The student doesn't understand, doesn't understand, and then gets used to it." That's the same here—** **we understand that you are not a computer, so you won't be able to load three pages of definitions of different concepts into your brain at once to operate freely with them. But you will get an idea of how intelligence, thinking, mastery of thinking, and thinking methods are generally discussed.**

For us, the main thing here is to show the place of systems thinking in overall thinking, not even of a human—but of all agents (and we believe you already know what "agent" is from the "Rational Work" course, but we will repeat this many times later). The text of the first section also shows an example of using systems thinking itself, as well as the reasoning of methodology as "the science of work methods". We do not expect you to immediately understand what is written here, but by the end of our series of courses, it will all seem natural and won't require additional explanations.

So don't get stuck on this ontology, don't get stuck on the first three subsections, but also don't "pass by." The last section of our course is about the same **synopsis** (a brief presentation of ontology without explanations and examples), it is titled "Instead of a Glossary: Ontology of the Third Generation Systems Approach" with a more or less formal presentation, it is dedicated to the content of the third generation systems approach. But in the first section, we offer a different ontology as a set of concepts and relationships among them to discuss the place of systems thinking among various other fundamental and applied types of thinking.

The following text significantly utilizes the knowledge about types of objects and their relationships obtained in the "Rational Work" course.

**"Intelligent Agent"**/"agent in the narrow sense" can be a human, AI-agent, organization. An agent is a **creator**::system, performing universal physical transformations of other systems. A creator is a system that performs all possible transformations of physical world objects. The concept of a creator is built as an extension of the concept of a computer/computing machine, which performs information transformations. Just as a universal (Turing-complete) computer can perform all possible calculations given sufficient memory and time resources, a universal creator can perform all possible transformations of physical objects—given the necessary energy and time. We can consider that the creator includes a computer/computing machine, which sets the program of transformations. A human is a universal creator, in which the computing machine is mainly realized by the brain. All this will be discussed in detail in our "Systems Thinking" course and subsequent courses of the curriculum.

An agent "consists of"/"composition relationship":

**Organism** ("hardware" of the agent—the body, “hardware part”), this also includes **exobody** with **exocortex**, and even resources **owned** by the agent, such as some **toolset/tools/instruments** **(set of instruments/equipment/hardware),** enhancing the hardware capabilities of the agent. If it is a collective agent, then it refers to all bodies together.

**Personality** ("software" of the agent, "firmware"/"program") consists of a set of all of the agent's **skills**. Skill with the involvement of the organism performs **tasks** by some specific method **/way** for this skill. Personality consists of:

**Life skills,** including

**Intellect** consists of

**Skill**::computing machine, executing
**method/practice/way/culture** **of thinking** 1 (e.g., conceptualization::method) from a set of methods of strong thinking (further this set of methods will be called **"intellect stack"**). Method/practice of thinking 1 consists of

-   sub-skill of thinking using concepts from the **theory/discipline** of this thinking method 1
-   Sub-skill utilizing **toolset** (set of tools/tools/instruments/equipment/hardware, most often in the case of a skill within intellect—it's a modeler) for this method/practice 1

Skill of thinking by method/practice 2 from the methods of the intellect-stack 2 (e.g., skill of thinking semantics)

...

**Skill of self-care,** consists of

-   sub-skill of thinking using concepts from the knowledge/theories/disciplines of self-care (how to sleep, how to eat, how to treat illnesses, how to start a family, ...)
-   sub-skill of applying self-care tools/instruments/equipment/hardware (how to use a toothbrush, ...)

Set of **applied skills** as computing machines capable of achieving some specific results in a specific applied subject area (e.g., aviation, management, trampoline jumping)

-   Set of applied sub-skills of thinking using concepts from the knowledge/theories/disciplines of applied subject areas
-   Set of applied sub-skills of applying the applied tools/equipment

**Thinking** can be understood in two meanings (we will use both):

-   In a narrow sense—it is the computations of intellect (i.e., computations of the set of skills in the methods of the intellect-stack)
-   In a broad sense—computations of the agent-creator by any type of its skill (including applied skills).

The concept of the method/way/practice of work in its distinction from the work itself—is the subject of a separate course, "Methodology", the science of method. Discussing the method is difficult because different types of relationships get mixed up. Thus, thinking is the method/function/practice of intellect. But it is appropriate to ask: "What method of thinking did you use?" This is not a tautology “what method of method did you use”, but an attempt to express in layman's terms a metonymy: it means work of thinking::method and an attempt to find out which variant/type of this thinking::method was used.

We distinguish between work (achieving some result) and method/way/practice of work. We also distinguish between method/way/practice of work, theory/knowledge/discipline/algorithm of this work, and tools/equipment/hardware for work. Method/practice of work is the way the work progresses (behavior patterns), not the description of the way of work. The theory/explanation/algorithm is the description of the way of work, usually not too dependent on the used tools/equipment/hardware but closely related to it. To reiterate: for all these nuances there is a whole course "Methodology", you will take it next.

Thus, in the narrow sense—**thinking** **is calculation::function/process/method** **of intellect’s work::"part of personality"::"set of skills by methods of the intellect stack"::"set of** **computers, working by methods/practices of the intellect stack".** This set of methods is discussed in the "Intellect-Stack" course, and we will briefly list them below in the text.

The feature of thinking::calculations of intellect as distinct from calculations of various other types of skills is the focus on solving new and new classes of problems. Thinking in the narrow sense (calculations by methods/ways of the intellect-stack) is aimed at **knowledge** as creating new and new explanations/theories/knowledge for new and new methods, allowing agents then, both individually and collectively with the help of various tools of these new methods to change the world for the better, participating in endless **techno-evolution** (and even interfering in **biological/Darwinian evolution**).

**Systems thinking** **is the use of** **concepts of a systems approach** (system, subsystem, and supersystem, emergent property, system level, etc., we will discuss them throughout the course) in thinking in the broad sense. These concepts help to model the world as consisting of **important objects**: interacting nested **systems**. These systems are **physical** **objects**, stable in relation to the impacts of the continuously changing and not always friendly **environment**. The systems somehow maintain the **boundary** between themselves and the environment, they do not mix. Over a long **time scale**, these systems also **evolve**, achieving greater and greater stability to the unpleasant **surprises** from the environment.

Modern intellect is a human-machine computer, and often it is collective, meaning thinking is conducted by a group of people supported by computers. And even without computers, human biological intellect is enhanced by external reliable memory in the form of notes on paper or paper books. Systems thinking implies the use of records; thinking doesn't all happen in the biological brain. **Don’t write/model** **in the computer or at least on paper—** **not thinking systematically.** Now, not only humans can think systematically, but also a computer with an artificial intelligence program if they are trained to do so. Even an organization can think systematically (i.e., use concepts of the systems approach in thinking and related modeling), although what "thinking" is for an organization and what kind of thinking intellect it has is still a matter of debate.

Another dispute is whether intellect’s abilities are “computations” only, as the skill of thinking by the methods of the intellect-stack includes methods of working with tools/instruments. This may include in thinking some physical processes, which physicists might reduce to informational interactions (meaning it can loosely be said that it's "computations"), but in everyday life and even in engineering, they are no longer thought of as such. For instance, to verify thinking about what is happening on the far side of the Moon, one could create and send a tool there: a spacecraft that will measure some characteristics—and then the thinking continues. To include or not include the creation of tools (a microscope, a rocket, a synchrotron, a multi-story building, a genetically modified tomato, a thermometer) in thinking is unclear. A creator—this is an extension of the concept of a computer to an agent that changes the world, so it is quite easy to equate "pure thinking as computation only" and thinking that includes the use of tools for changing the surrounding world. A tool can be a shovel, a computer, a robot, or even another person trained to perform some work by chosen methods specifically for this purpose.

The main point is that modern intellect is based on fundamental (from the intellect-stack) methods of thinking, relying on knowledge/theories/disciplines permeated with concepts of the systems approach. With the addition of these knowledge tools (in the simplest case—an exocortex in the form of any way of taking notes, even pen-paper), intellect manages to reason about systems of various scales/physical sizes: from elementary particles to quasars. Intellect also manages in cases when some creators (e.g., humans) create other creators (e.g., robots, or organizations of people)—and since these are all systems, discussing such situations of "creators creating and developing creators" also uses concepts of the systems approach, this will also be systems thinking.
