title: Emergence and Division of Labor
---

In the last paragraph of the previous subsection, the concept of **emergence** was introduced — the appearance/emergence at each systemic level of properties in systems that did not exist in systems at the previous systemic level. A clock can show the time, but the gears, springs, and case of mechanical clocks — no, the transistors in electronic clocks — no.

New/emergent properties make it necessary to use a specific applied discipline/theory for explanations at each scale/size/systemic level. Systems thinking allows one to unravel the intricacies of segmenting the world into systems from different systemic levels ("segmentation" should not be taken literally; it is "segmentation by attention," highlighting systems as figures from the background). Thus, at the core of intellect's effort in creating and utilizing different applied methods of working with their disciplines/theories/knowledge, serving to understand what is happening at various systemic levels, lies systems thinking. The methods/approaches/practices/styles of systems thinking help navigate the complexity of the surrounding world remarkably effectively.

**Division of labor** occurs when different intellectual agents (people and AI) specialize in methods of working with a particular scale of systems. For example, an agent in the role of a therapist deals with the human body as a whole, comprising organs. In contrast, an agent in the role of a pulmonologist specializes only in treating lungs. The division of labor is based precisely on systems thinking: systems of different scales are divided by systemic levels and then studied by different sciences and altered by various types of engineering.

One agent cannot deeply master the alteration of all systems of the world at all systemic levels; they simply won't have enough computational resources for prolonged learning. If it takes a year to learn a method of work to a professional level (a very conservative estimate! Try to learn to play the piano professionally or become a professional organizational architect in a year!), then in thirty years, one can learn only 30 methods of work — and by the time one reaches the thirtieth, it will turn out that the first learned method is hopelessly outdated. But there are thousands, tens of thousands of work methods! One agent's lifetime is insufficient to master them all professionally.

Therefore, division of labor occurs, with different agents specializing in different methods of creating and developing various systems. **To understand what mastery in which work methods agents in your specific project should possess, you need** **first** **to segment the world into systems, select those important for your project, then choose a method for working with these important systems, and only after that select an agent who can work according to the chosen method. And** **this is where systems thinking comes in handy; here a universal and scale-independent intellect should work, since one needs to think about systems, methods of working with systems, and agents who will work with systems (i.e., translate systems from one state to another).**

Before diving into systems thinking study, it is essential to understand **general** **criteria** **of strong** **thinking** as strong intellect thinking. These criteria are also applicable to systems thinking. Additionally, one must answer the question: what is the difference between **systemic** **and systematic**, as they are often confused.

There are many variants of systems thinking in the world, based on different versions of the systems approach, so it will be necessary to understand which variant we teach in our course and why we teach precisely this variant.

Further in this section, there will be some explanations about the course:

- how to treat terminology (words-terms are important, and not important!),
- how to choose the degree of rigor/formality of systems thinking,
- how to ensure that systems thinking helps rather than hinders creative freedom (the course provides templates for effective thinking that work excellently, but is there "template creativity"? Yes, of course, creativity can and even should be by the template! Without a template, it is much easier to produce banality rather than something new!).
- can thinking be taught at all, or must one simply be born intelligent? Of course, it can be taught.
- what stages are there in learning to think?

And only after discussing all this in the next section will we begin to study the basic concepts of the systems approach and related thinking techniques of the most diverse fundamental methods of the intelligence stack.

Let's immediately say that the material presentation text ("textbook") from our course is like a bicycle riding manual: reading the course as a book will tell you a lot about systems thinking, but it's not guaranteed that after reading the course as a book, you will become a systems thinker. Practice is necessary! Even systems thinking exercises have their specific features. Moreover, in the process of learning, you also need to start using thinking in real life, which is even harder than learning to solve tasks. A task from the course you just solve, but in life, you first need to formulate the task and then solve it — and formulating tasks is harder than solving them.

The prerequisite for our course is the "Rational Work" course. After it, you:

- have learned not to confuse words/terms and concepts,
- have learned to distinguish physical objects from their descriptions,
- do not forget to record modeling results,
- do not require definitions for concepts,
- find objects of the given type in the surrounding world,
- keep your attention on found objects when the usual hustle and bustle of everyday life surrounds you, and the world around is flickering, and you have no time to concentrate,
- find the type for objects of the surrounding world from the proposed ontology if their type is unknown.

But if the "Rational Work" course was about various types of different objects, in our "Systems Thinking" course, we will explain that the main objects one should focus on are objects of the type "system". For questions on how to think about types, head to the support chat for "Rational Work"; for questions on how to think about systems (which are also type!), head to the support chat for "Systems Thinking"; for questions on how to think about systems of the type "rhetorician" (master of persuasive speech methods — rhetoric::method/culture/approach/practice), head to the support chat for "Rhetoric" (but not to the systems thinking support chat or the modeling and composure support chat).

The continuation of our course will be the "Methodology" course, where the concepts of the systems approach will be used to discuss methods/activity/practice/engineering/culture/style/technology of creating and developing one system (creators) by other systems. Living systems "grow on their own," but if we are talking about creating something by intellectual agents (people with AI and their organizations), then it is necessary to discuss how to describe patterns/templates/methods/practices/cultures of works on creating systems. A company founder creates a company that creates a machine that creates a part. Course authors write an educational course ("textbook" with "problem book"), and then the teacher creates some applied mastery in the student (person, cat, AI). How to describe this collective engineering, how to think about it? This is what methodology is concerned with.

Further, systems thinking and systems methodology will be used in the course (scale-independent, for all types of systems) of systems engineering. And then there will be courses on personality engineering (in fact, a course on engineering through teaching: changing students for the better by teaching them) and organizational engineering (course "Systems Management"). This is roughly half of the "Organizational Development" educational program, three semesters.

Of course, systems thinking is used by agents to accelerate understanding applied work methods. This is part of the behavior of strong intellect. Therefore, we first teach systems thinking and methodology and only then move on to studying courses on applied work methods with "hardware" and software systems, personalities, and organizations.

**Mastering systems thinking** **is** **another step** **in strengthening the intellect,** **that is** **another step in learning** **fundamental/transdisciplinary** **thinking methods** **of the intelligence stack.**

To repeat: don't get stuck on the content of these first two sections, or even subsequent sections and the course content as a whole. Progress through the course materials, spending reasonable time on each subsection, always completing assignments — understanding usually comes not immediately after reading the text of a subsection but slightly later. In the next section, we will discuss the peculiarities of presenting educational material in our courses. The main idea there: our course is not a Wikipedia, not a reference on systems thinking, and it is not arranged like a mathematics textbook with a couple of definitions for each topic and ten practice problems for those definitions. We are training not the classical logical computer in the heads of our students but the neural network in the brain (or even not in the brain, but in a data center, because our texts can also be read by AI agents).
