title: Roles of analysts and engineers. Positions
---

The roles of creators are performed by various org-link agents:
actors/practitioners/doers/engineers/workers. They all make the world a better place by creating and developing various target systems. Doers are not “observers-witnesses” as commonly understood in physics! Even in physics, it is accepted that there are no observers who do not change the world. To “observe” something, i.e., measure it, the measuring instrument and the measured system must interact. In physics, an observer doesn’t necessarily have to be an agent in the narrow sense (a person or AI who can plan), but under minimal physicalism—a molecule that measures its environment^[We've previously cited this work, but to reiterate: "Minimal physicalism as a scale-free substrate for cognition and consciousness," 2021, by Chris Fields, James F. Glazebrook, and Michael Levin <https://chrisfieldsresearch.com/min-phys-NC-2021.pdf>]. Moving forward, we will discuss situations where an “observer” or even “analyst” refers to an active agent who conducts measurements (“observes”) and even makes some judgments about the situation but does not take measures to improve it. Remember, the result of the observation by the observer or analyst (although they might be very active, e.g., climbing a tall pine to look at the world through binoculars) will be a description, an “analytical report,” after months of intensive work. This report usually contains an assessment of the situation but not a strategy (a method that helps improve the situation), and moreover—there is no constructive action plan for changing the situation (the “recommendations” part of the report is rarely included in the “analytical report,” often delivered verbally or in a separate informal document), and crucially—aside from the report and optional strategy recommendations as a method for forming action plans/works with realistic resources, there are no active actions by the agent to improve the situation (i.e., no actions to physically alter the system’s state, possibly along some creation graph); everything is limited to “projects” describing a possible future without actively working to make them a reality, and the descriptions themselves may well be utopian, with responsibility for implementing the utopias lying not with the suggesting analyst.

**Observers/analysts** **typically** **do not change the world,** **though** **they may have** **a subject of their** **role-based** **interest** (**a characteristic they find important in objects they observe)** **at the level of** **“interesting,”** **and may even have** **preferences** **in this point of interest,** **but** **the observer role agent does not intend** **to be** **anything more than an observer, without changing** **the observed situation for the better.** **Observers** **have no intention** **of actively changing the world. They view projects as if** **they were happening** **on television. From the analytical work conducted by specifically designated agents-analysts, typically,** **nothing** **in the project** **changes, plus there’s the broken telephone effect in** **translating the thoughts** **of real** **doers by outside observers/viewers/analysts.** In football, many spectators watch the game from the stands with curiosity, but the results depend only on those running on the field and kicking the ball, as well as those who “made” these players (coaches, masseurs, sports doctors). Indeed, many of these “stand/sofa analysts” know better what the ball kickers should do and how to prepare teams! But their opinions hardly influence anything, though they produce most of the noise in the stadium, while players usually run silently and shout to each other very rarely. Coach’s shouts are barely heard.

In this sense, “analysts” usually resemble household “fans”: they don’t need to do anything, just understand something and prepare an “objective report.” In rare cases, they also make “suggestions” for subsequent “approval.” These “suggestions,” later approved by someone, unmistakably indicate that we are dealing with an analyst, not an engineer/doer. An engineer issues “project documentation,” not “release proposals” needing approval by another engineer acting as “manager”! If a matter involves a designated analyst rather than an engineer, then:

-   The analyst has no “skin in the game,” they only “propose,” meaning their proposals are usually of lower quality than an engineer-doer who puts their skin in the game^[Nassim Nicholas Taleb, “Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life” (2018)]. The analyst may be called an “engineer” by title, but we’re considering the work method, “what they do, what changes states in their work, how this state change occurs,” to define the role, not by title. Only the work method defines the role! If they “prepare proposals,” not "implement accepted engineering solutions," or “design,” it’s an analyst. Have you “proposed” something approved before implementation? You’re an analyst.
-   Analysts often closely observe a situation and then relay their extremely condensed description (model) to developer-doers. This leads to the broken telephone issue: how descriptions can significantly distort the situation, how model reading can introduce errors. Labor division matters, but “analysts” like “requirements engineers” vanished because the broken telephone problem was severe (more on this in the “Systems Engineering” course).
-   It’s incredibly slow, tied to cascading communication awaiting responses from managers and subordinates at multiple levels. “Proposal-approval” instead of independent “solution release” on four levels, with a one-week review time for proposals adds three weeks to the project. If “give proposals” is mandated top-down, add three more weeks for four levels, totaling six weeks. Four levels—general, deputy, department head, and executor. Large organizations see even more delays, making it slow.

Sometimes, an analyst's declared lack of preferences in interests (an “objective,” investigatory view) signifies they lack an active intention to change towards a preference, lacking a combined **synthetic** role, if not implementing the solution themselves, then at least synthesizing its description. **Synthesis**—reverse of decomposition/analysis, typically means designing affordances assembled into a system, i.e., inventing and creating the system “physically” as per the synthesized project/design. Engineering includes both analysis and synthesis, without synthesis—it's not engineering! **In our “Systemic Thinking” course, we intentionally exclude “system analysis”!** **The course is for doers: engineers of various systems (cyber-physical, organisms, personalities, collectives, communities) changing the world for the better!**

A classic “analytical report creator” analyst might need time and resources to “observe,” conduct “measurements,” survey people. For instance, running from the stands to interview players on a football field. This can be productive: they might accidentally ask something the player never considered—bringing unintended benefits! But often not, if this “analysis” is not followed by “synthesis.” If there’s “synthesis,” the role isn’t named “analyst,” but something else.

To turn an actor playing an analyst role into a truly proactive actor-doer/practitioner, simply assign them an engineering **position**. A position is the name of an org-link performing varied activities, implying resource allocation (e.g., a director manages diverse roles and resources).

Simply renaming the “analyst”::position to “engineer”::position usually suffices. Detailing the culturally-conditioned name of the engineering/managerial role helps: reassigning the former analyst::position to a new “engineer-architect”::position or “engineer-developer”::position. Then the engineer (former analyst) begins not “proposing” to others assuming responsibility for his work, but independently “resolving,” making engineering decisions, and issuing them under his own name (not manager’s), assuming responsibility for implementation. Positions are about responsibility (meaning of “responsibility” varies). Positions also elevate status. Buyers prefer negotiating with a manager, not a salesperson::position. This was resolved by renaming “salesperson”::position to “sales manager”::position. In consulting firms, “sales manager” may become “vice-president” (as in IBM consultancy divisions, with numerous vice-presidents). Ignore titles; look at roles by work methods. What an agent does determines their work method, role. Name positions by core work methods of the main role agent is hired for, expressing "responsibility," "reward level," "qualification" with "chief," "senior," “leading,” etc.

Separate positions and roles: A person in an engineer position might spend days playing a manager role, and vice versa, a manager might handle engineering tasks long hours. Elon Musk claims he spends 70% of his time solving engineering tasks, playing a technical engineer role (cyber-physical systems engineer, commonly called “engineer” in lay terms)! Musk is an agent/actor, with founder roles as an engineer of new organizations and manager-organizer, operational manager roles (he’s CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter/X) taking less time than engineering cyber-physical systems!

Positions are described by job instructions, roles by work method descriptions. Work methods are typically outlined in textbooks/regulations/standards, detailing theories and method tools usage. Which textbook (format—sector and corporate standards, instructions, regulations—is irrelevant) shapes the thinking of an engineer position holder? If it’s “operational management,” they play the operational manager role, their position matters only for administrative reasons like pay schedules. Positions matter for power: authority over own and others' work, equipment and resource allocation. But for intellectual effort, positions take a backseat to roles. **Agents think and act as actors in roles,** **so roles, while** **positions only** **“implement authorities.”**

If an analyst position holder says, "I think the rocket should have three stages instead of two" (a cloaked term for “proposals” needing subsequent “approval”), an agent/entity must make a decision on this opinion. If an engineer::position says, “the rocket will have three stages,” that’s a decision, needing no further approval. For analysts, approval is necessary. Do you feel the situational difference? “Proposals” vs “decisions”: how you name the boat determines its sail, the same averments have varying directive status based on the role and position cultural conditioning.

Cultural-conditioned—drawn from common meme complexes, not specifically invented. If you declare “analysts” as full engineers, don’t delude yourself, it’s like calling “white” genuinely “blue.” You may inform staff, but culture will override your naming by tomorrow morning.

The analyst role, combined with the decision-maker synthetic role within the combined engineering role conducting analytics and synthesis, becomes a full project role. If “analyst” proposes something as a recommendation—it’s not an “analyst,” it’s a “synthetic,” needing formulation, making engineering decisions (not just understanding), and that’s not analytical but synthetic work!

Positions often derive from typical roles. If the position is “analyst,” don’t expect synthetic work. If it happens, it’s “despite” cultural agreements. This doesn’t negate “systems analysis” methods, but the role “analyst” should preferably be assigned to the same person doing system/module synthesis, enjoying engineering synthesis decision-making authority, not just “responsibility and authority for checks and understanding.” **Activity approach:**
**“understood/explained—the** **take action, i.e., seriously treat understood/explained** **and change the world accordingly!”**.

If an actor playing a project/doing role dislikes or likes something in the system/project concerning the system, or any significant characteristic of interest/preference, they start acting proactively, “probing by action,” not merely “actively observing/measuring,” but realizing their preferences, trying to change the situation with their role methods. Additionally, an actor may switch roles, pursuing a strategy/activity for intention realization^[This refers to the “pragmatic turn” in philosophy,
<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/>]. If an actor in a role does nothing to realize their interest/preference in an important characteristic, they’re ignored in the project. They're a passerby, non-project participant, with no project role, performing no role-based actions, not working in a creation chain project affecting the target system or system(s) graph creating the target system. If someone walks past a design bureau window, they clearly have no project role, even if we see them (especially if unfocused, attention wandering to random objects). But if a potential system buyer passes the window, capable of contributing money to the project, we’ll try to attract and address their interests.

Usually, agents (e.g., people) practice their usual activities/labor in habitual roles, when a new system appears or may appear in their life—this system offers opportunities (e.g., new “features” for users::role, or team members::role who welcome a new project to continue system development as a series of endlessly improving versions) or obstacles (playing competitors or political/religious idea supporters roles—they’ll actively play and creatively implement their preferences!). Agents encountering a new opportunity-system or threat-system retain focus on it—acting, changing the world, either utilizing the opportunity or eliminating the threat.

Certainly, material on “analysts” vs “engineers” suits the “System Management” course more, but it aptly illustrates the relationship between work methods, roles, and positions. For positions and roles, Kozma Prutkov’s saying holds true^[[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Козьма\_Прутков](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Козьма_Прутков)]: “If you read ‘buffalo’ on an elephant’s cage—don’t trust your eyes.” Then what to trust? By deeds (work methods) and used terminology in those deeds, we know the role. Position—uncertain what real authority accompanies a prestigious title. Even a “main doer”::position might lack real power, merely “proposing” for “approval.” Remember, guards wear suits now, and those they guard wear tees. Don’t judge by attire, not by titles; judge by work methods/cultures, assess terminology use of theory/discipline/knowledge methods in speech.
