title: 'Thinking About Agents (Humans and AI): First and Foremost, They Are Role Performers'
---

Of course, in real life, we directly see primarily the performers::constructive --- specific actors::agents playing roles, not the "roles" themselves. But while discussing the play or role-playing game, we exclusively talk about roles, unless we're talking about the qualification of the agent, i.e., the quality of following the method of a particular agent, the quality of maintaining oneself in the performance of the role. Here, the agent's skill in executing the method is important, but so is the strength of the intellect, including the collectedness within the intellect to sustain oneself in executing the method the agent's role in the project must engage with.

Who says the phrase "to be or not to be"? Prince Hamlet, or Vasya Pupkin? At the moment of playing/performing the role, they are the same object, just called differently, and we pay attention to different properties of this object based on this. When talking about the "character"/role, we focus on the text and plot (of the play, role-playing game, project to create some system, not much changes here when moving from a precise play "by Shakespeare" to improvisational role-playing with the Prince in a role-playing game, or the improvisational playing of a business architect in organizational development projects), and when talking about the "performer playing the role," we focus on the quality of the performance and the availability of the performer::resource at the moment of the play/"passing the game"/"flowing of the work project," that is, the moment of role-playing (hence, all these different concepts end up being the same indication of the time of role-playing, "exploitation/functioning of the agent as a role performer").

We can always point out to Vasya Pupkin that he misunderstood the role in the game or project (stricter in a play—"poorly learned the role"), or plays someone else's role and in various ways indicate, "you're wrong, Vasya," if we know the play, or role-playing game, or the plot of the work project he is playing. If Vasya's plot and role are unknown, we can't understand whether Vasya is right or wrong in his actions, "is it according to the role" or "that's not allowed!" Helping a person hold their role and play it effectively — that is leadership. If the leader does not know the role and its method of work, no persuasion to "work well" will correct Vasya: he will do something very well, but entirely unnecessary for the project, and the leader (who doesn't know what is needed) won't track it. If a ship does not know where it's going, any wind will be unfavorable. If the leader does not know which role to persuade Vasya to work well in, and Vasya himself does not know this role and is incompetent in the method unknown to him, no persuasion will be effective. First, the leader needs to know the role of the actor he is persuading, understand the method of work for this role, and then leadership towards the agent-actor (role performer) will become possible.

**System thinking** **therefore** **requires an activity-based** **horizon** **(a minimal horizon is given in courses "Systems Engineering," "Personality Engineering," "System Management") for recognizing work methods** **and roles** **of workers by these methods** **in work project circumstances.** In particular, discussing from which role the leader takes the understanding of the method of the role's work he "persuades" an agent to execute and what roles are generally there — exactly in these courses, while leadership as a method of leader's work is discussed in "System Management," and the leader as a subtype of teacher is discussed in "Personality Engineering."

In 1997, A.Tyukov highlighted the following activity areas: politics, religion, philosophy, art, science, education, healthcare, physical culture and sports, technology, design, commerce, finance, law, the army, material production, and "yet-to-be-formed enlightenment"^[<http://psyhoinfo.ru/programma-sozdaniya-obshchestvennoy-professionalnoy-sfery-prosveshcheniya>]. Since then, several decades have passed, and huge questions arise regarding this classification. It is clearly very anthropocentric and reflects some ideas about state structure. Previously, it was normal, but now it is understood that the bases for considering methods in their fragmentation into smaller parts and highlighting alternative options may be entirely different. However, the choice of a specific classification (what types and kinds of methods exist) is a "terminological dispute" and is not significant; offering other classifications is not very productive. Although we ourselves propose some "typology": we classify methods by the type of evolutionary complexity of systems they deal with: inert substance, cyber-physical systems, living beings, agents in the narrow sense, organizations (collectives of agents), communities, societies. Then one can unify the most diverse methods of creating and developing systems into methods of engineering, finding much in common in the methods of very different projects.

For example, it can be noticed that the work methods (activity/practice/labor) of a visionary in engineering projects, a cultural promoter in educational projects, and a businessman in organizational construction projects are very similar; these are all methods used by the theoretical role of "Schumpeterian entrepreneur" from the textbooks of the Austrian School of Economics (not to be confused with the everyday meaning of the word "entrepreneur," but specifically "Schumpeterian entrepreneur")! And then it becomes easier to identify such a role and adapt its work method for a variety of projects. This approach of unifying all methods as methods of engineering (creating and developing successful systems) is what we apply in our courses.

More importantly for the horizon is that "yesterday's horizon" doesn't mean "today's horizon." Many different new methods of achieving certain necessary world states have emerged and continue to emerge, while an enormous number of obsolete methods/practices/cultures/activities/types of labor have vanished and continue to vanish every day. For instance, one can hardly find cashiers who count on abacus beads in stores anymore, though it was once mandatory! And the role of cashiers as such is disappearing; the wallet is rapidly becoming the smartphone. In engineering, it's increasingly challenging to find design engineers working with 2D-designing, a clear marker of old production order reserves; such production should be seen as museum exhibits. Modern enterprises operate quite differently. **It is necessary to have not simply a horizon as "extensive experience with old** **work methods, knowledge of the old set of roles," but a horizon of the modern state** **of work methods and active roles by them.**

Without a horizon in methods/culture/activities/engineering/types of labor, there is no systems thinking, as it is transdisciplinary, aiming to unify the role-based thinking for these separate activity areas. So one must be able to recognize these roles within projects.

We recommend having horizon knowledge of at least the following work methods in the modern multi-level world, sorted by systemic/evolutionary levels (called "levels of organization" in biology):

-   Discussions on "engineering for the entire universe in general" are still purely theoretical (living gods creating worlds have not yet been encountered or found traces of), but we will state it for completeness.
-   Civilizational engineering in the universe, including our and alien civilizations as a whole. There are activities already happening involving study and sometimes even projections of cosmic-scale changes (e.g., Fermi
    paradox is actively discussed
    [<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox>],
    there are projects to detect
    "technosignatures"
    [<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technosignature>],
    and even discussions of technical solutions for the energy issues of civilizations using the maximum amount of energy from nearby stars — this is genuinely cosmic-scale engineering,
    construction of Dyson spheres
    [<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere>]).
-   Development of the "anthroposphere," or in layman's terms, improving humanity, including its tools and the entire living environment. We::humans are still the only ones on a small globe and it would be good to change all of humanity for the better (including protection from asteroid dangers, extinction due to technological catastrophes, growth barriers due to ecological constraints, etc.). Unfortunately, there is nothing good to show along the line of conscious world change, despite organizations like the UN supposedly working on it, but techno-evolution and biological evolution continue — the Enlightenment, which began with Voltaire and Rousseau, still continues
    [<https://ailev.livejournal.com/1574477.html>].
    The most significant change here is the advent of AI agents, whose participation status is unclear, but due to which anthropocentric/parochial world descriptions now need to be replaced by less anthropocentric ones. In our course for 2023-2024, we carefully replaced "people" with agents, highlighting that the development of the anthroposphere doesn't necessarily involve only humans.
-   Public activity, which is done by public figures, often called "politicians." The methods of "social" (that is, with communities and societies) work based on
    normative
    [<https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/normative>,
    <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-normative/>,
    <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economic-justice/>,
    <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-normative-utility/>,
    and so on.]
    (that is, engineering) economics,
    sociology, political science, or without these theories, using the method of "trial and error" (in the systems engineering course, it is mentioned that engineering can be both scientific and non-scientific). The subject of the work method (activity/practice/labor/engineering) at this organizational/evolutionary level is the society in which the worker/engineer/practitioner using the method does not know the counterparts by face, as there are too many of them, does not know the interests of these counterparts, as they can play very different roles. Yet, society can still be sufficiently organized, i.e., have some sort of management in the form of divided or combined legislative, judicial, and executive authorities, and these organizations through the subordinated armed organizations can force everyone else to follow the orders of a few agents (not necessarily humans!), i.e., can set norms of social organization and demand their enforcement. There can be a variety of societal engineering goals: setting boundaries on "their" territory (not necessarily on Earth) and counteracting their disappearance in aggressive environmental changes (say, wars with other societies) or changes in their organization (say, seizure of power by a religious or health fanatic, or dictator, and their subsequent conscious or unconscious work on destroying this society because of some irrational beliefs). The objects of engineering at this level also get mixed up: "society," "people," "nation," "country," "state," "citizens." Projects of communism construction, empire creation, just attempts to ensure prosperity at least on the level "we have fewer starving people, there are more elsewhere," attempts to establish different variants of "democracy" with different divisions of power — these are precisely engineering projects of this systemic level.
-   Cultural construction, community engineering, engaged in by cultural figures (including engineering culture, political culture, managerial culture, not necessarily figures of arts or hobby culture). A community as the subject of engineering/construction/development — definitions of subculture, counterculture, community, community of practice, learned society, school of thought from Wikipedia (look them up): all talk about one and the same thing, emphasizing different aspects in different languages, using different terms. We can also speak in different languages, emphasizing different aspects, but about the same object "community." In Russian, this will be subculture, counterculture, community of practice, community of learned (figures, “learned/educated in some craft,” not "scholars/researchers"!); “invisible college.” But one can also talk about a tribe (very fashionable!), and a "municipal formation" like “a village where everyone knows each other,” fellow-countrymen of former (or even current) members of one community in another society. We orient ourselves to the Dunbar's number [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number (150, as much as human biological memory can hold), but with modern computer tools, human memory quickly grows, and discussions about this number are becoming less reliable. In Mordokniga, there is a limit of "friends" to 5,000 people as the number of acquaintances with whom a person can at least somehow be familiar and maintain relationships not only with their own memory but also with computer memory. But this can be a much larger number. For instance, the number of cyber-physical systems engineers who joined the International Council on Systems Engineering in 2022 is over 19,000, which means these people consider themselves members of the systems engineers community, thus about their role interests are roughly known, but it does not mean that we are talking about a traditional organization creating a specific target system. The staff headquarters, however, deals with community construction as a target system. It's easier to think about communities not as organizations of community members but as organizations where community members play their roles—if they all have the same activity, then they are in roughly the same roles in different projects, which determines their commonality. Then some "project office" as an "internal consulting organization" becomes the organization for project managers' development, develops the project managers' community. And then the Dunbar number is less significant. It should also be noted that promoting a product, service, some preferred work method with its knowledge and tools is community creation. Promotion (marketing, advertising, sales) as creating clientele (a community of clients) is here. On the one hand, to create clientele, one must perform personal engineering, giving knowledge on the promoted methods to individuals, but on the other hand—to approach a specific person with methods of personal engineering, it is first necessary to find this person, i.e., to approach an unknown circle of people first, i.e., to build a community, and this second part about "perform personal engineering for unknown individuals—where to find them, previously unknown?" here it is discussed, on the community level.
-   Organizational construction/management/“organizational engineering”/“enterprise engineering,” done by managers/organizers/“organizational engineers”/“enterprise engineers.” The subject of their work methods is the organization, understood as a group of agents (most often people, but we remember about scalability and AI agents) with clear powers over each other's work and other resources. Organizational engineering at the operational/working/operational stage of the organization is operational management. There is a separate system management course, which in fact is an enterprise engineering course, an applied horizon course, the concretization of the fundamental scalable systems engineering course for the systemic/organizational/evolutionary level of organization (enterprise, association headquarters, non-profit organization, fund, etc. — a collective of agents).
-   Education, psychotherapy, coaching, conducted by teachers, psychotherapists, coaches with such an object as an active personality. This is all "personal engineering" (although not said that way, we recommend thinking exactly so!). Should it include different variants of teaching "intelligent robots," i.e., personalities not based on Homo sapiens, i.e., personalities as rational conscious agents-organisms at the level comparable to Homo sapiens (conditionally xGI, different types of general intelligence)? Why not. Therefore, one can consider both AGI (artificial general intelligence) projects and the creation of cyborgs (usually human and organizational, but here more human) in terms of exocortex and exo-tools/instruments (internal personal level parts of personality, individual and collective—we maintain that while the conversation seems to be about one level, it can easily be transferred to others. Say, "education of an active organization," not only "education of an active personality," but historically the level of one personality stands out quite clearly). Roughly speaking, "memory and computation addition," because artificial vision, liver, etc., addition is already a lower systemic level, "creatures," handled by other work methods. We have a "Personality Engineering" course, providing insight into the methods of personal engineering as an applied variant (specialization) of systems engineering methods.
-   Methods/activity/practice/engineering of creating and breeding/"serial production" of living beings, "organism-making." Done by practitioners/engineers of living nature like agronomists (plant-growing), farmers (animal husbandry and veterinary medicine), foresters (forestry), as well as doctors (medicine). Humans are also living beings! If concerned about the working capacity of the human body (a "self-engineering" course is being developed), and not just personality ("Personality Engineering"), these are specifically methods of living being engineering. These methods of creating and developing living organisms/beings include "systems biology" with "systems bioengineers" developing and producing fully artificial life, and "genetic engineering" modifying genomes of already existing living beings on the planet.
-   Classical systems engineering of cyber-physical systems, done by classical "hardware" and "cyber-physical" systems engineers. It deals with systems that lack intelligence but already include a universal computer-controller. Rockets and airplanes, nuclear and solar power plants, smart (i.e., sensor-equipped with some actuating devices) homes, and other traditional objects for tech engineers. Software engineering is also here. To some extent, the "Systems Engineering" course is designed not only as a method of mind stack but also contains many examples of applied classical engineering methods, both "hardware" and software. It provides insight into creating and developing systems at this level.
-   Substance (molecules, simple physical parts): this ranges from organic synthesis by chemical engineers to the engineering of soap dishes and electric bulbs by design engineers, i.e., the engineering of simple/inscrutable (without complex cyber/computer/computational) system components without complex control with controllers-computers in their composition.

Of course, in life, you will encounter projects requiring simultaneous consideration of creating and developing systems at very different systemic levels — including various levels of evolutionary complexity of these systems. The contradictions between systems of different systemic levels manifest precisely here: liver cells want as many of them as possible, and the organism considers this cancer. Some citizens do not wish to support a “state” as the organizer/engineer of society in their residential area and are considered "state traitors" and punished. How to resolve such contradictions? Invent new and new engineering techniques.

But you need to somehow understand what kind of engineering methods will be required in your work project. The simplest way to do this is to list the specific types of systems affected by your project, assigning them system types from our course. For example, if you are creating a lactobacillus tablet as a dietary supplement, you will need to change (including persuading it to be taken—changing the state of individual human personalities as parts of the clientele) systems at the following levels of the stack:

-   Consumer oversight::community and society
-   Clientele::community (promotion)
-   Client::individual agent (personality and organism)
-   Stomach and intestines::being
-   Tablet::substance
-   Lactobacillus
