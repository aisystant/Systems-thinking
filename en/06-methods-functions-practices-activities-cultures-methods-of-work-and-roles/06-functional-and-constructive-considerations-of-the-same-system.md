title: Functional and Constructive Considerations of the Same System
---

The term "function," as we discussed in the first section, has many different meanings. Very often, role-based behavior/action (behavior for a specific purpose) is called a function. For instance, the usual usage is “the function of a hammer is to drive nails.” If a verbal noun (ing form in English, a reference to the continuity of action) is used instead of a verb, it usually means function/process/method.

**Works** (instances of processes) considered as instances of performing the "work method" ("the system playing its role"), engaging resources/constructs, are often expressed by an infinitive verb or (if it is a plan) in the imperative mood for the resource performing the work. The job (what needs to be done specifically with instances of objects at a specific time) will be planned as "hammer nail number three into board number four no later than 4 PM," with the expected result being "nail number four hammered into board number four no later than 4 PM." Subsequently, the method by which the work will proceed can be discussed. Indication of the method (what generally needs to be done) would be "hammering the nail into the board" (in essence, the method/means::behavior is the hammering, and the objects of the method are the nail and the board), and once again, the options of how to do it need to be discussed, as just the name of the method is usually insufficient (there are few types/patterns of behavior), it often needs to be specialized to a specifically understandable variant (to move from the genus to the species—it’s inappropriate to say "beast," since the genus "beast" includes the species "tiger" and "mouse" simultaneously). For example, "hammering" is specified down to "nail into the board" (the objects of the method are specified), then it can be further specified to "hammering the nail into the board with a nailing machine"—here, besides the knowledge/theory/explications of the general method "hammering" and specifying it with the objects "nail" and "board," the method's name also includes the tools that will be utilized by the specific specialization of the method "hammering."

In our course, **we will distinguish works/actions** **and** **methods/means** **of work.** Methods mention types of resources at the moment the method is engaged, whereas works require instances of resources, that is, material/constructive objects necessary to engage the method. Therefore, works as "work resources" will be performed by systems::constructs, and the methods of these works will be performed by systems::roles (and one can discuss whether or not to include the objects of the method's work, which will need to change their state, as well as the tools that expand/augment the agent's body performing the work by the method, in the system composition).

Identifying functional and constructive systems with their works and practices will be as for the "warm object" and "orange object," as well as the "object on the window," which are simply descriptions of the same material "kettle": through 4D extensionalism.

Systems::roles (functional objects as a subtype of physical objects) are interesting in that they can disappear from the physical world and reappear completely different—at the moment they gain a new affordance as "role performer." A "hammerer" disappears when we stop hammering with a stone and suddenly appears as a microscope when we start hammering with a microscope.

Again, we repeat: systems as roles are quite physical. Although some philosophers insist that roles (role-based/functional objects) should be considered abstract objects, engineers and managers listen to other philosophers who point out that most people consider **functional/role** **objects** to exist when some **material/constructive** **objects** play their role and do not exist when no objects play these roles.

We can think of Prince Hamlet, implying that he exists at the moment when his role is played by an actor (for example, the famous artist Vasily Pupkin). At that moment, one can conditionally "knock" on Prince Hamlet, point a finger at him (the place he occupies in space), moreover, he occupies not only a place in space but also a place in space-time. Prince Hamlet, as a functional object/role, behaves in some way, meaning he is needed in the context of the play. When does Prince Hamlet go for lunch? The answer: never, as Vasily Pupkin goes for lunch, and Prince Hamlet does not exist during lunchtime—he ceases to exist at that moment because he "does not play the role"/"does not perform the functions"/"does not function"/"is not used." And if Vasya Pupkin falls ill? Then the role of Prince Hamlet will be played by another actor.

The same reasoning applies to the pump::construct and the blower::role. The "water blower to the third floor"::functional/role object exists when a certain pump with a serial number plays that role. Then it disappears from the world when this pump breaks down and is dismantled, and when it is replaced by a pump with a different serial number and it starts working, the functional object appears in the world again, but it is realized/embodied by completely different molecules of matter. Remember, "starts working" is important here: all functional/role considerations only during operation/use. If you think the functional consideration of the creating system (some plumber, alternately realized by Petya or Bogdan) refers to the creation time, then for the plumber as a creating system, it's the time of his plumbing use, the time of performing works by plumbing methods (performance of the plumbing function/method/practice/culture). No confusion: always remember the time we are considering the target system: if it is a functional consideration (utility, usage results), then it's functioning/work/use, and if it's constructive (seeking affordances, processing them to change states from raw to a ready working system), then it's creating and developing time. And yes, there can be long chains of such consideration (creators creating other creators, and so on for multiple steps until the target system—if you create game sessions, some engineers should create game software in the data center, and someone should organize the engineers who will then create this game software, and someone must somehow create those organizing engineers, all these chains and even creation graphs in life are quite long).

Function/"role behavior"/practice/method of carrying out works is assigned to the system's works, based on some patterns of system behavior during works, that is, achieving resultant environmental changes. So, even the oven changes its state from "cold" to "hot," meaning it performs the work "heat up well for the night of January 15, 2054, in room five" only for the surrounding area to become warm (that is, to become warm in the oven's environment). Thus, "oven" (functional object) will be chosen as a specialized electric heater with a good convection radiator and sufficient power (constructive affordance—that construct chosen), not some isolated heat source well insulated from the room (e.g., we will not declare a "thermos with a liter of hot water"::construct as an "oven"). Further, one can debate whether to call an electric heater or a gas heater an "oven." Is "oven" a "role" or "construct"? Since function is primary, "heating," it is more likely today to call a "wood-burning stove" a "heating stove" or if the main use is cooking, then a "stove kitchen plate" (fully understanding the historical context of "plate," indicating not function but the construct of a "flat surface").

In all these considerations, it is necessary to avoid definitions (cease the argument about terminology, names, etc.; these are just "strings of symbols," they will be different in various languages, this is not so important) and discuss what place in space-time the discussed items occupy, "ground"/groun. The role/role object/functional object and the material/constructive object playing it will, of course, occupy the same place in space-time. At the same time, a role object can disappear from the physical world anytime its role ends—when the constructive/material object ceases to play its role. A material (that is "an object made of matter") object cannot be destroyed just like that—the law of conservation of matter acts, a material object can change, but it cannot just suddenly disappear; it just changes its states and roles it plays.

For instance, I can highlight in my life "my favorite toy"::role. Then choosing one affordance/construct out of many as "my favorite toy" occurs based on what results I expect from this construct playing its role, what changes in its environment (that is, in me) this construct-in-role will induce. So, "favorite toy"::role, its affordances were "teddy bear"::construct 55 years ago, "toy airplane"::construct 50 years ago, and today "coffee machine"::construct. In the interim, perhaps I was not up to games, and this role/functional object "my favorite toy" did not exist during that period. Physical individuals of constructs playing the role of the functional object "my favorite toy" changed several times, but the function "priority involvement in my games, entertaining me" remained the same.

"My favorite toy" (incidentally, if you remove the highlighting quotation marks from the term—will you recognize it as a system in role? In real life, your systems will not have such cues!) at the moment it exists, it quite occupies space—you can knock on it, smell it, speak about it as a physically existing item. But, of course, you will be knocking and smelling the constructive/material objects playing this role at specific moments. If you wish to smell Prince Hamlet, you will smell only Vasya Pupkin, playing his role. Or the smell of Bogdan, if Bogdan plays. Or nothing at all if Vasya Pupkin or Bogdan are not playing this role—without a performer of the role (constructive!), there will be no Prince Hamlet. But indeed, the smell of Vasya Pupkin or Bogdan will be the smell of Prince Hamlet, as their appearance will be the appearance of Prince Hamlet, as their function::"behavior during the game by role" will be the sequence of actions of Prince Hamlet.

Why are role/functional objects needed? To separate in thinking the performing of certain actions (goal: to change one state of the target system to another) from the objects performing actions (creating systems with their tools). Actions (in the case of agents—work methods) are not that many in the world (one can compare their types number to the conditional number of verbs in the language—several tens of thousands), but functional objects suitable for actions (like nouns, of which there are hundreds of thousands in the language) are vastly diverse. Therefore, one can discuss the method/activity/practice/function of the work of an "agronomist" (role of engineer for plants::systems) or "manager" (role of engineer for organizations::systems) and accumulate knowledge about this method/activity/practice/culture/"type of labor"/engineering—regardless of who performs this role now, Vasya or "AI-agent Thomas."

Similarly, one can highlight the object "water pump"::role and its function "increasing water pressure" and then use either a pump::construct with a certain serial number manufactured by Murom plant in this role (this will be affordance), or a "water tower"::construct, which will need to be built by some contractor or by ourselves (then it will be the affordance). The reasoning here is the same about roles and instances of "homeland," "tree," "internet provider," and "water pump." All role/functional considerations and affordance selection (affordance selection—invention! One must still guess to use an amplifying triode in key mode to create a computer, motorcycle engine as an aircraft engine!) are absolutely identical. And affordance selection is multi-level (remember the systemic levels! The reasoning repeats at each level, "recursively"). And this reasoning is the same for people, animals, and artificial intelligence systems ("undead"), as well as for inanimate systems.
