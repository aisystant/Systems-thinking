title: Typewriter
---

Systemic thinking significantly engages your skill across a range of fundamental disciplines of the intellectual stack thinking methods (physics, concept theory, semantics, logic, ontology, ethics, etc.). By the time you study the course on systemic thinking, the **typewriter** should work well in your head and body. Yes, in the body too, because **ontological jitter** **as a type error signal** is noticed as a sensation in the body, which is one of the interfaces to the computations happening in the brain. This typewriter is built up in students during the course "Rational Work." The teaching of skill as the engineering "fabrication of skill in the student" is studied in more detail in the course "Personality Engineering."

If at the entrance to this course the typewriter works for 20% of students, then at the exit --- almost for everyone. The course teaches you to highlight objects in the text or the world by the specified type of object with your attention and then keep these objects in your attention. This retention by attention is not "mental" because we do not trust the reliability of the biological brain, even if this brain is trained on “good attention,” but technically --- attention is retained by recording, preferably on a computer.

What's next? As one of the graduates of one of the previous versions of this course said to his classmates, where the "Rational Work" course was not yet mandatory prerequisites, "I don’t understand at all what you read out from the systemic thinking course material if you haven’t taken the rational work course!"

The typewriter is responsible for assigning and controlling types in some descriptions, documented in texts both in natural language with a low level of formality, and in models of objects and relationships, documented in texts (or even diagrams) in a highly formal language. The main thing is that the student (the future master) should not only have a rational understanding of the fact that there is always some type for an object but that their typewriter works with sufficient fluency in work projects.

What is behind the typewriter? The brain supports the work with different concept theories^[<https://iep.utm.edu/concepts/>]. One of the simplest concept theories explaining the results of the brain's work in "fast thinking S1 mode according to Kahneman" is the prototype theory when we imagine some prototype object for each object and then act by analogy. In this theory of concepts, all thinking is continuous metaphor processing, looking for similarities. Another theory of concepts is the much more complex theory theory^[<https://iep.utm.edu/th-th-co/>], in which typed concepts are linked by relationships (which can also be expressed by concepts). It corresponds to slow S2 thinking, formal thinking, and logical constructions. And texts like "the sepulka is an animal. Does the sepulka have a backbone?" are parsed by just such a thinking mechanism. If you know that animals have backbones, then the indication for the sepulka type “animal” is quite sufficient to figure out that — yes, the sepulka has a backbone. If you haven’t mentally classified the sepulka or just didn’t hold this classification of the sepulka in your attention until the second sentence in this short text, you’ll be puzzled about how to answer about the presence or absence of a backbone in an absolutely unknown object?!

If you want to think systemically, then you must have a typewriter embedded in the brain and body. The slow S2 thinking mode is present in systematic thinking almost always: we think systemically with substantial involvement of the theoretical theory (theory theory) of concepts. If you don’t remember theory theory, you need to return to the "Rational Work" course.

Say, you were informed: “A leader is a role. What role does the leader play?” If you don’t have a typewriter in your head, you’ll start making up some everyday metaphorical things about the leader, relying on fast S1 thinking and the prototype theory of concepts with metaphors and images: that he leads people, that a leader should be an example for the actions of others, etc. (check yourself, answer the question and write down the answer).

If you have a typewriter in your head, you should be puzzled: “A leader is a role.” At this moment, the leader is marked by the type “role.” The next sentence is — “what role does the role play?” Because if the leader is marked in your mind as a role, you retain this even to the second sentence and check for type compliance. The question “what role does the role play?” should stress you out because its meaningfulness is low. **A typewriter embedded in the head exposes all nonsense in the text; it is needed for criticism during creativity.**

If they told you that the engineer is Vasya’s role, then it’s not good to ask the engineer how he slept today. The engineer is a role, just like "dad" in playing "house" or Prince Hamlet in a theatrical play. The sleep was good for the agent (human or even AI that needs “sleep” for further training) playing the engineer role in the work project as a role-playing game, or “dad,” or Prince Hamlet. It’s the actor/agent who should be asked about “good sleep.” Such a question to the engineer::role is a typewriter failure; the brain should automatically forbid this, raise the alarm! In principle, if someone considers that they are not playing the role of a king, engineer, or tree in a fairy tale, but they themselves are the king, engineer, or tree, they have gone mad. People and AI must be clearly separated from their roles.

How do you recognize when the term "engineer" refers to a role, a position, or the actor-in-role::agent? From the context, but for this, you need to be collected/attentive and hold in mind that “an engineer” is still a role, not the agent playing this role. Vasya sleeps, not the engineer. Vasya "plays the role" of an engineer::role (that is, performs::works “work method”/"type of engineering/activity," **the roles of agents “perform methods”/ “work by methods”::behavior**) just when not sleeping! Without dealing with types in such situations, one can get confused.

On average, the typewriter reliably "automatically" works in the head without special training (which takes place in the "Rational Work" course) in about 20% of those with higher technical education (that’s only two out of ten people), if not fewer. Why so few? After all, all people use the brain's S2 mode, slow logical thinking? This is unknown. What needed to be done to make it work reliably? There are different hypotheses; one of them is reading a large amount of non-fiction and dealing with formal models that require holding long chains of reasoning with the use of types in the head. This guess is indirectly confirmed by experiments with large language models, which are initially trained on program code (these are formal languages with strict type checking) so that their ability for logical reasoning grows exponentially^[<https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00812>].

If you are not among those 20% of the population whose typewriter "just is, don’t know where from," then it will be extremely difficult for you to engage in systemic thinking without the "Rational Work" course: you simply will not understand the material. **Systemic thinking is all based on theory theory, and logic there shines through seemingly absolutely artistic and humanitarian texts. But no, these texts are stitched with types: systemic thinking forces you to operate with types much more frequently than in ordinary life. This work with types gives power to systemic thinking.** **If you by default use prototype theory or sample theory as your thinking tool instead of theoretical theory/theory theory, then you will not cope with our course and will not be able to master systemic thinking.**

Systemic thinking gives a meta-meta-model as a set of types. Systemic thinking types ("system" with its different subtypes, "environment," etc.) point to the most important objects of attention in a work project, help model, and compose systemic descriptions of the world. And remember, systemic descriptions need to be documented somehow; they are written, not "in the head."

In our course, explicit type assignment happens using the **::** notation, for example, airplane::system. By now, you have already encountered it many times in our texts.

Thus, our prerequisite for the systemic thinking course is a well and fluently working "typewriter." Without it, you won’t have systemic thinking, and there won’t be communication in complex projects either^[See Pripion Medvedeva's talk at the 6th SSPM conference, "Typewriter: Why It Is Needed," <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T7P64GARzY&t=28850s> (from 8:00:50).].
