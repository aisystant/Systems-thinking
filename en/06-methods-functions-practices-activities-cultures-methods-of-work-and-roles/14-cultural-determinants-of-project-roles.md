title: Cultural Determinism of Project Roles
---

We are primarily interested in thinking techniques, and particularly in the preservation of experience — transferring experience from situation to situation, from project to project. Thinking occurs not so much with facts as with knowledge: abstracted from facts about specific physical objects, knowledge about the most important. The "physical body" abstracts a vast number of situations in which the laws of mechanics apply: from a spaceship flying to the Moon to a basketball being thrown into a hoop. "Target system" abstracts many situations in which some system is created and developed — from a smartphone launch project to the construction of a city block.

When intelligence encounters a situation it hasn't seen before, it needs to highlight some focal objects of attention in this situation, which would allow it to latch on and try some familiar thinking moves that offer the highest expected probable effectiveness, and not just random moves with deliberately low effectiveness. These thinking moves should help find explanations for what is happening in the situation until new information can be obtained and adjustments can be made. Systems thinking is part of this general knowledge of the methods of the intelligence stack.

Knowledge about working methods and the roles that utilize them (methodology), the normative division of labor, i.e., the normative division of engineering into separate engineering methods and assigning them to different agents in various roles during the creation and development of systems (systems engineering) — is also part of this general knowledge. This knowledge is significantly enhanced by a broad labor horizon — understanding how the project division of labor can be organized for different types of systems being created (the division of a type of system engineering into types of methods of this engineering and then assigning roles that perform these types of methods to different agents). For instance, in hardware and software engineering, roles such as visionary, developer, architect, and internal production platform engineer are distinguished. In education (personal engineering) — similar roles, but operating by slightly different methods, characteristic of creating and developing mastery as a target system. These roles include a culture bearer, author of educational materials, curriculum architect, and dean's office. In management (organization engineering) — businessman, organizer, org-architect, administrator, whose methods work with the organization as a target system. Of course, all these roles along with their working methods are further divided, into even more specialized roles and methods.

Knowledge of an effective and efficient working method and the proper execution of this method in a professional/activity/project role, successfully tested by various agents in numerous projects — it is culturally conditioned, meaning it is not invented anew in each specific situation. The systemic approach directly appeals to the knowledge of civilization, i.e., to the culture accumulated by humanity. The term "culture" has two main meanings:

- Method of work, "culture as cultural behavior" in a long synonymous series of "method/mode
  of work"/culture/style/practice/activity/labor.
- A set of human (and now more than human) knowledge about the world and material/constructive objects ("material culture"), of artificial (created by people, and now by robots) origin.

Here we are talking about the systemic approach using the accumulated knowledge of humanity about working methods and the roles that follow them, not inventing everything from scratch in each project. If you do not know what methods are needed to achieve certain results and hence which roles of agents you will need — Google it or ask an AI assistant. For example, if you need to feed someone not at a restaurant but on-site — that's catering, and if you need to host a festival — that's event management, and universities even teach this. You can, of course, come up with something on your own, but it will be amateur catering, an amateur festival. The difference lies in the fact that professional role execution is stable and, despite various inevitable surprises, it will yield results, whereas amateur execution is unstable, sometimes matching the level of professional execution, but upon slight changes in the environment — completely failing. Professionals do not make rookie mistakes.

Utilizing the systemic approach implies having some activity/labor/application horizon: if you are not familiar with the culture, you will not see which roles people play in relation to the project — their important characteristics will seem unimportant, and preferences will seem like whims, personal traits of the agent, and not recognized as civilizational, culturally conditioned, role-related objects of interest and associated preferences in the states of these objects of interest. If you do not know "from the textbook" that the roles of a developer and architect typically conflict, you will be surprised why "production conflicts" flare up around some agents performing these roles for various systems (although their positions may be named entirely differently). Depending on the communication style, these conflicts will either escalate into personal ones or not, but for those unfamiliar with modern systems engineering and management, these conflicts will be inexplicable. However, if you are familiar with the explanations of modern development methods and the roles therein, you will know what to do. If you know how to turn almost any customizable software into a universal modeler — you will know how to quickly and easily perform organizational modeling in an organization. If you don't know — success will be purely accidental.

If you encounter Vasya::agent, who is concerned with the structural strength of the system::characteristic (construction strength:: "important characteristic"/ "object of interest"), it is unlikely that Vasya is performing management::method/practice in the role of manager::role. Talking to Vasya about deadlines:: "object of interest" and budgets:: "object of interest" may not be productive, not the right project role and its method of work. Conversely, if someone refuses to discuss construction features but is willing to talk for hours about resources for work, these resources' cost, and approximate job completion times — that's a manager.

A labor horizon should be enough to reliably recognize these roles in work projects, and at a fairly detailed level! Just as you wouldn't confuse a gynecologist with a dentist, thinking of them as "just doctors," you shouldn't confuse different types of roles not only in medicine but in all other methods/practices/"work cultures"/"types of engineering"/activities. If you lack a methodological/labor/activity/practical/cultural/style horizon, you will have enormous difficulties in systemic thinking: you won't be able to figure out the roles in your project.

Project roles (professional roles, i.e., by methods of work in the project, not by positions!) are not invented. They are culturally conditioned. **If one is not** **familiar with** **labor/production culture, it will be tough: the actions of people in the project will seem** **unpredictable and random. But it is not so. People's actions** **(i.e., work by** **some methods)** **happen** **"in roles," they are absolutely not random, they are easy to predict.** **If you know Shakespeare's play, you won't be surprised that the Moor strangled someone after asking about evening prayers —** **the Moor is not a person but a person-in-role, he acts not out of inspiration and situation but according to his role. There is a pattern in his actions, and it will definitely manifest. If you don't know Shakespeare's play —** **you will be surprised at the very appearance of the Moor and then by every line of dialogue.**

**Activity/practice/labor/engineering/method** differs from random individual operations and actions with objects at hand, randomly selected as preferred states. Activity/practice/labor/engineering/method — is targeted similar/repetitive/patterned actions/works of various agents, which we consider as actors with role (i.e., typical, by role) targeted behavior following their preferences in objects of their role/functional interest.

Engineering here stands in the general synonymous line because it is associated with world-changing, i.e., creating new or developing/modifying existing systems. Notice that the word "work" is intentionally omitted here, and there "activity" is not synonymous with work, it's synonymous with "actions." This difference between methods/practices/modes/cultures (how to do something) of work and the works themselves (the instance of doing it with its resources, separate from "how") was briefly discussed in our systems thinking course but will be elaborated in the methodology course. Activity/practice/labor/engineering are synonyms for the method, the mode of work execution; it does not refer to the use of resources during work; it refers to the behavior pattern, "what types of objects interact and how to achieve desired states of needed objects as a result." Works are associated with "operational management" as "enterprise operational engineering," and for non-living systems — operational engineering, where it doesn't matter how the system functions but its specific operating time, the instance of the system itself (if replacement during repair can be discussed) and other aspects of asset management, also a method of management. Works are logistics and resources (to ensure everything is on time and not lost), work methods are to ensure everything is done correctly, substantial engineering consideration.

Also, when discussing methods/activities, we still talk about creators in terms of creating some target system, often people, and with people, everything is highly complicated; agents are complex in conversation. When it comes to inanimate target systems, the discussion becomes simpler, and instead of long synonymous lines, people often talk about functions and functional objects. Sometimes functional objects also have synonyms, often called "tags," because in hardware engineering, functionality tags are often attached to objects (e.g., such codes are taken from ISO 81346).

Talking about agents as actors who follow the method in their roles (or play practical/labor/engineering roles — simply different lexical ways to say the same thing) is very similar to role-playing games, which are popular among rather narrow hobby communities of role-players^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game], although the first association is usually theatrical plays. The difference is mainly in the fact that in theatrical plays, all characters/roles speak lines written by the author at specified moments (following the play/script), while in role-playing games, characters/roles determine their actions and lines themselves based on the current situation and some principles (the same script, but defined more freely). In Shakespeare's "Hamlet," all the lines of "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark" are known, but in a role-playing game "medieval Denmark," the actor/player playing Prince Hamlet composes his lines himself based on the circumstances. In any case, his Hamlet will not be interested in airplane ticket prices to fly to England; that contradicts the principles of role-playing. 

The principles followed to perform their method/activity/practice/labor by various project/activity/organizational/labor/professional roles are prescribed in textbooks and taught in universities. Sometimes these principles are written in international, industry, corporate standards. Sometimes even in regulations, protocols (for example, medical ones), work instructions. Usually, they don't train for a position, since a job position will require performing multiple roles! They teach executing work according to a specific method, playing a particular role, following a role's script/pattern! How these roles are then distributed across positions is another question.

Agents performing the work methods of their project roles do not do whatever they want in projects; their actions are not arbitrary! They improvise, of course, but their improvisation is like actors' improvisation in the theater: whatever they do, it turns out that these actions are somehow conditioned by their role, not entirely made up; they cannot be "any." If you think the engineer is wrong in their preferences, you will seek to replace the performer of this role — and it will be no surprise to find that the accommodating new performer of the role, after understanding the new project, suddenly states the same objects of interest and exactly the same interests in them as the previous engineer role performer! **The role proves more important than the personality of the performer!** **As the mastery of executing the work method used by the role grows,** **all agents-performing this role** **with the most diverse personalities** **become similar.** At low mastery, they simply do not follow the work method, i.e., do not play their role, hence making many rookie mistakes. Niels Bohr defined professionals as people who do not make rookie mistakes. And here the question is, what is a "rookie mistake": in the 17th century, doctors and chefs (agents performing their roles) were not required to wash their hands or work in sterile gloves, but in the 21st century — it is mandatory, unwashed hands — a rookie mistake, moreover, such a mistake should result in firing the agent from the profession, not allowing them to work.

About methods/activities/"types of labor"/practices/ occupations/ cultures/styles of work, we think "in classes/types," work by certain methods is performed by classes of agents (people/organizations/agents/actors in their roles), for example, people in the roles of engineers, artists, kindergarten teachers, lovers, astronauts, teachers, athletes. While playing roles, they engage in methods of work described in textbooks (instructions, corporate standards, regulations, codifications), realizing role preferences in important characteristics of various systems (both target systems for the project and creator systems). When these people engage in other "methods of work"/activities/practices/ occupations/ cultures/"types of labor/engineering," they play other roles, manifesting different role interests in various objects of interest. If you want to get a response from some chatbot, you should not just ask questions but specify from which role concerning which work method you want to hear the answer. If you ask a manager how the project is going, you will hear "we are two days late with the current version's delivery," and from the engineer, you will hear "we are changing the second circuit pumps, they failed the tests". We always remember: “\-- What is two plus two? --- Are we buying or selling?”.

If you want to understand the "objects of interest"/concerns and associated preferences of some agent (person, organization, AI-agent), you need to know the culturally conditioned (meaning prescribed in textbooks, general for all, not anyone's specific!) objects of interest and preferences/interests in them for the role they are playing. This agent will perform some activity/practice/occupation/labor/method of work to achieve their desired preference in their object of interest. If it's a financier, they will strive to avoid a cash gap; if it's a manager, they need to get the product on time — and a potential cash gap will concern them only to the extent that they need to negotiate with the financier who doesn't want to take credit, which the financier will need to discuss with the businessman (e.g., his role may be played by one or even several "founders"), who doesn't want to take extra risks.

You should have a labor/activity horizon, be familiar with multiple work methods, recognize many roles that follow these methods/protocols/scripts in life, know their objects of interest/important characteristics of systems and projects and preferences/interests they will implement in projects regarding these objects of interest. Our courses in systems engineering, personal engineering, systems management (organization engineering) will help, but these courses alone are certainly insufficient. At the same time, "industry experience" may not help if "twenty-year experience is a one-year experience repeated twenty times." Horizon diversity is essential, after all, having knowledge/explanation/theory about varied situations.

A labor horizon will give you the ability to see in all agents not first and foremost people-actors with their "character traits" and "personal peculiarities" (or "corporate cultures" with some anthropomorphization of the organization's behavior, as if it's a person, or likening an AI-agent to a human), but specific work methods that these agents employ in their roles, ways agents conduct work. Only after understanding what the agent is doing, determining the role they perform, can one discuss whether the actor playing this role is suitable — whether it be a human, organization, AI-agent, or even a simple machine, thus evaluating the agent's qualification in the role.

Literally: first, you understand that it's about "brewing coffee"::method, next you say "coffee is usually brewed by a barista::role", then look at the qualification level of Masha or Petya as baristas (to what extent they possess the barista's skills, that in difficult situations they can brew coffee without making rookie mistakes).

If agents do not perform any work methods (do not do something according to role, "by method"), i.e., if they are inactive, they should not interest you: do not waste your attention on them. A "spectator" who does not play in your game, does not participate in your performance, does not want to pay but is keenly interested in the performance without any intention to participate — is not a spectator (an agent in the external project role of "spectator of the performance"), they are just a passerby.

Systems thinking is managing attention, focusing on what is important, ignoring what is unimportant. Roles performing their work methods concerning the target system or creators of this target system — that's essential, and agents not performing work by roles' methods, so they affect the project (i.e., the system-creators in their project activity) and its target system during its operation — are not important, we ignore them.

Add ethical considerations here: if your system or project for its creation harms some agent, so that they are half-dead and cannot object, such an agent must be considered in the role of being affected by the system: for example, the role of "poisoned by our system" and the method of performing this role — "suffering." Do not ignore the roles of those agents affected by your system and its creators! Culture/style of work “quiet death of all who passed by our pipe” will be less noticeable than the culture of "a tough fight with the creators of those who passed by our pipe to make them move away everything they created from our pipe," but you must track such behavior, identify the role of the worker in this culture “affected by our pipe” (another expression for "all who passed by our pipe," considering the transformation from "passing by our pipe") and take their preferences into account.

**Positions, personal** **qualities, personal** **preferences-not-by-role, all this turns out insignificant compared to playing some culturally conditioned role, including the mastery of playing this role, the mastery of** **applying work methods** **by the role. Thus, you need to think first about the role** **and** **its methods/practices/"work processes,"** **and only then about the position and** **personal qualities of the agent on that position, playing the needed role.**

Systems thinking is managing attention, managing figure-background distinction. You need to look at Ivan Ivanovich::actor yelling loudly and emotionally at the meeting, and perceive not his personal speech but his speech as reciting the role's text (yes, it's hard, you need to train Attention: to hear the role's text and respond to this text, not the emotions of Ivan Ivanovich in his shout. Of course, for the conversation you need to track the actors' emotions as well, but without a substantive review of the role's replies, you won't find a way out of the situation that caused the shouting).

A labor horizon should be enough to recognize Ivan Ivanovich's role who’s shouting, attention should be enough to keep this role in focus, not Ivan Ivanovich's personality or position. This role vision should not wander, attention should reliably capture the role vision! And then you need to answer this role, not the person or position. This is even more challenging: looking at living person Vasya Pupkin and responding not to him but to Prince Hamlet, whom Vasya Pupkin plays — it doesn't matter how well he plays. You need to respond to the role! Systems
