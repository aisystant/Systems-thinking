title: From the Target System Through the Method of Work to the Role of Creator, but Not the Other Way Around
---

For simple systems, such as the construct "hammer," the **veracity**::"intelligence characteristic" is extremely low (more details in the course "Intellect Stack"). For human and AI agents, the intellect is stronger/more universal, and the veracity is much higher (they do not need to be "reassembled" hardware-wise to change their construct; they can be taught certain behaviors by giving explanations—"reflash the hardware to a new algorithm" rather than "rebuild the hardware anew"). Additionally, such agents can utilize various affordances to include in their composition as a system; these affordances for performing methods of work by creators according to their algorithms/theories within the creator system are called **tools/tools** (in the case of measuring instruments—**instruments**).

Recall that "agent" has two meanings:

1. Broad—anything autonomous that is in a nonequilibrium stable state (from an atom or molecule to a cat, from a cat to an urban agglomeration with a couple of million residents and numerous buildings and structures filled with household and industrial equipment).
2. Narrow—an agent in the broad sense but specifically one that is capable of planning actions that lead to a sharp deterioration in its condition to then improve its condition (say, spend all resources on purpose-oriented bow and arrow creation to hunt more effectively later). Usually, this word "agent" refers to people and/or technical systems with sufficiently strong artificial intelligence (AI agents). And here there are constant debates about whether the intellect of AI systems is sufficient to call them agents in the narrow sense, or they are agents only in the broad sense.

We will further talk mainly about agents in the narrow sense: humans and AI. And since we will now speak mainly about terminology, not concepts, the "strength of intelligence" here will not be very important. You will understand it yourself; it is simpler to talk about the function of driving nails for a hammer or the culture of driving nails with a hammer. Most likely, in the first case, the role will be the hammer, while in the second case, the role will be some agent that includes the hammer. But even for the agent, we can say that its role is to drive nails (whether by hammer, microscope, or electric nailer, it's up to their discretion). How to know what to say, how to understand the spoken word? From linguistic intuition. We just remember that "function" for "agents" most often sounds like "method/way of work"/"type of labor/engineering" etc. However, thinking about role and construct is the same! Role and its function—"why does this agent need to be a system," construct—"which system-agent as material/construct is taken affordance for the role."

It is always necessary to clarify which specific "method/way of work" is chosen to perform its role as an agent with strong intelligence: due to the versatility of the agent, there may be surprises. When we say "surprises"—it usually means "an unpleasant surprise," a discrepancy with expectations. For instance, an inexperienced worker in the role of a carpenter will perform the method of "binding boards" without distinguishing screws, nails, glue—included, for example, driving a screw with a hammer (and in the first seconds after doing this work, it may even seem that the boards are securely fastened with the screw!). At the same time, no one will likely use a microscope as an affordance for a "nail driver," but humans and AI will easily, even if they do not know how to perform work according to some method. Patient/sick::role at the doctor's::role:

--- Hello, doctor::role, I have a stomach ache.

--- What did you eat yesterday?

--- I ate a pigeon.

--- Did you eat a naked pigeon?

--- Yes, I caught, plucked, and ate a naked pigeon.

--- Did you eat the pigeon’s head?

--- Yes, I ate the pigeon’s head.

--- Did you eat the naked pigeon’s head?

--- Well, I ate a naked pigeon’s head. So what’s the problem?

--- Hm-mm.. Frankly, I am a speech therapist::role, but I helped as much as I could!

You cannot understand roles if you do not consider their functions::behavior. And let's repeat: the behavior regarding the way to achieve changes in the environment for different agents will be called very differently: functions, practices, organizational processes, methods, ways, types of labor, etc.

If "the one called a doctor" (i.e., an agent taken as a construct for performing a function/method) is skilled in speech therapy::method and not gastroenterology::method, the outcome of the situation will be approximately the same as in the joke. Do not forget to set types while roles are defined by their function, i.e., behavior that predictably changes the state of certain objects in the environment (in the case of agents' roles—this is the method/way/practice of work, activity, culture), not by construct/material (for example, an agent considered as "just an agent"). You can’t predict Vasya’s role if you don’t know which objects Vasya changes in the environment and by what method! **Without understanding what method the agent works with, roles cannot be understood!**

An additional source of confusion with roles is modeling subroles by two variations of hierarchy relations coded by the prefix "sub-":

- Regarding composition for the role. For instance, a speech therapist is a superrole for a doctor (since the speech therapist also performs a doctor’s methods of work, such as any doctor, "they all studied 'medical science' in university," but in addition, the speech therapist has a method of work for establishing speech, so the general composition/set of methods/practices/functions/ways of work of the speech therapist is larger than the methods/practices of the doctor; the doctor here is a subrole for the speech therapist. This conveniently extends to the agent’s skill: a speech therapist's skill consists of the skill to establish speech and the general skill of a doctor, so the doctor is a subskill. In skill, the same relations exist; the training of a speech therapist is longer than that of a doctor; here, the doctor is a subskill.
- Regarding genus-species relation. If we take "called a doctor" (i.e., described by the classification "doctor"), the speech therapist appears as a "specialization of a doctor." In this view of the skill, it is not specially discussed; all doctors have some specializations, and the speech therapist is simply a part of doctors specializing in establishing speech. Here, a subrole is a species, the doctor is a genus, and regarding specialization, the speech therapist is a subrole of the doctor.

We recommend relying on the line of reasoning related to the function/"method/practice of work" of the role object (role), the skill of performing this function by the constructive object (agent, e.g., a person or even an organization)—and therefore consider "subrole" as a node in the hierarchy relative to the composition/compound/"part-whole" for the skill. It is convenient for engineering (e.g., planning training).

In everyday life, you will often encounter classificatory descriptions where the term "sub-" indicates specialization. Another term, also multi-meaning, is "meta-", which has many different meanings regarding some levels^[<https://ailev.livejournal.com/1053878.html>]. We use it when talking about meta-modeling in the sense of "a higher level of objects in the hierarchy regarding classification."

For the composition relationship, we use "sub-" as in "subsystem," and "super-" as in supersystem. In particular, a subrole is literally a "subsystem," and a "superrole" a supersystem (systems are usually defined by their roles in the supersystem, subsystems by their roles in the system, and roles by their functions::behavior). Should we use separate types of prefixes for specializations? You can use "species" to indicate a species for a genus, for example, "a speech therapist is a species of doctor, do not confuse it with a gastroenterologist," "a salsero is a type of dancer, another type is tanguero, do not confuse," but classificatory schemes are more or less arbitrary in highlighting important objects (but good for highlighting various, not necessarily important objects^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_Animals_(Borges)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_Animals_(Borges))]), and we will rarely use them.

But in life, they are often used; in everyday use, modifiers "sub-" and "super-" are also used for them, which can cause confusion. How to understand? Only by context: encountering "sub-" and "super-", ask about what type of relationship they denote? What will be the skill for performing the practice—is it greater or lesser? Another criterion: when talking about specializations, they usually mean a choice of mutually exclusive roles—say, a speech therapist and a gastroenterologist. In composition/assembly, by definition, roles are added, functions are added: functions of a gastroenterologist::role and/or speech therapist::role are added to the function of a doctor::role. And the agent's skill of a speech therapist and/or gastroenterologist is necessarily added to the skill of a doctor (a doctor is someone who has mastered the academic subject "medical science").

If it is a specialization hierarchy concerning "genus-species," nothing needs to be added; only a description is needed—and one can discuss "choice": speech therapist::species or gastroenterologist::species for doctor::genus. In any case, pay attention when working with subroles and superroles—does it mean the system (and there will be a composition relation, everything is physical) or a type of system (and there will be some descriptions of specialization, often showing contrast). "Tiger" and "mouse" do not enter the composition of "beast," they are simply "species of beast!"

In Krylov’s fable "Trouble, if the pies begin to bake the shoemaker and boots stitch the pastry-cook," it is a typical metonymy. Let's set the types to clarify what is meant: "baking pies"::method of the "pastry-cook"::role, "stitching boots"::method of the "shoemaker"::role. But in Krylov's fable, the shoemaker::"agent with the skill of the shoemaker," meaning the shoemaker is not a role but a construct/material for the role of "pastry-cook," mistakenly used as an affordance for "pastry-cook"::role. That is, the "shoemaker" is not a role! The same goes for the pastry-cook, who in Krylov’s fable is not a role but a construct/material for the role of the shoemaker.

In real work projects, there will be the same confusion between roles and constructs: a construct successful as an affordance for one role can be assigned to perform another role. And if the conversation in terminology confuses roles and constructs (this is probably inevitable!), problems will arise. A good step here would be to switch from the language of roles to the language of functions (well, or in the case of people and AI as creators, to the language of methods/practices/culture/style/ways of work, types of labor/activity/engineering, etc., the synonymy here is extensive).

However, Krylov, the fabulist, does the same: he confuses roles and constructs but explicitly mentions the methods of work "baking pies" and "stitching boots," indicating the subject of the method of work role (an object changing state during work by the method: pies, boots) and the name of actions to change the subject of the method (baking, stitching). And who performs these actions with the subjects? A role embodied by the construct/material.

A function/method is the behavior of an embodied (when it is embodied/realized by some construct/material, i.e., during the use/exploitation of an already created in the physical world) system as a pattern of changing the states of some objects in the environment (and these objects sometimes call the subjects of the method). For creator-systems, in their environment, we find target systems of their creation methods (methods of changing the state of subjects in the environment, ultimately leading to the creation and development of systems). Speech therapy changes the state of speech skills, gastroenterology changes the state of the gastrointestinal tract, medicine changes the state of the body. Or, speech therapy::method changes the state of "speech skills"::"target system," "gastroenterology"::method changes the state of "gastrointestinal tract"::"target system," medicine::method changes the state of the body::"target system." This is all clear without the concept of "role performing work by method." This role is only needed when you are concerned with the agent construct/material that will embody the role. But if you start with an agent at the moment when the method of work and its target objects and actions are unknown, you will automatically end up in the situation of a speech therapist with a headache or a pastry-cook with boots: you have already chosen the agent, but what will the agent do—you do not know. Most likely, the agent's skill will not be the one needed to perform work by the required method when the method becomes known!

Therefore, in the case of household services, you need to understand first whether it is stitching boots or baking pies, and in the case of doctors—whether you need to adjust speech or remove stomach pains. **You need to follow the line of reasoning** **"target system—methods** **of its change—** **creator role—construct/material of the creator as an affordance (e.g., an agent with the** **skill of performing** **the method), but not the other way around!**

**We identify the role by its method, not** **the method** **by the role!** **If besides the role name, it is unclear what exactly it does** **(i.e., which objects it transfers to what states by which method)—clarify!
A role without a method/practice is** **nothing!** **The method/culture/style/strategy/activity** **is defined by the objects that change their state** **and actions performed with these objects to change their states!**

If we consider the simpler case of a non-living target system that changes systems in its environment during its exploitation, rather than intelligent creator-systems and their methods of creation as methods of changing the state of different systems that then output a target system, the essence of the reasoning is the same: **always from the** **target system as a role and its function in the environment** **to the selection of** **affordances/"suitables for the role" from some constructs/materials.** **And never the other way around!** **If you do not know what your system does during exploitation, then you will not know what to make it from and how to design it during creation.**
Only the term has changed, "method" to "function"—the essence of the reasoning remains the same, thinking about animate and inanimate objects has remained the same.

Of course, these discussions about the target system and the systems of creating the target system can be extended to a chain:

- **first understand the role and function of the target system in the environment, "what it does" (time of exploitation/use/operation of the target system)**
- **then understand the construct/material that will be the affordance for embodying the role performing the function (time of creating the target system)**
- **then understand** **the methods** **of making the construct/material (methods** **of changing the state of the construct** **of the system** **from raw materials** **to the state of a** **ready** **and working** **target** **system)**
- **then understand what roles of creator-systems will perform these** **methods**
- **then understand what agents as constructs/materials for the creator roles will perform these** **methods** **of creating the target systems.**

**And never the other way around because if you do not know what you want to get in the end, i.e., do not know what and how the system should do with its surroundings, then you will not know what materials to take for making the system and how to process them, and if you do not know which materials to take and process you will not know who with the necessary skill and tools will be able to take these materials and process them to get a successful working target system.**

We just mentioned the "mantra of system thinking," a constantly recurring pattern that guides the reasoning of a system thinker in a specific direction. Use this as a checklist, ensuring that all steps in your thinking about a work project follow this mantra.
