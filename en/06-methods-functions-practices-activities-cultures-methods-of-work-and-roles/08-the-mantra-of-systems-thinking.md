title: Mantra of Systems Thinking
---

Traditionally, the question arises: shouldn't we start with roles right away? We wrote that people find it hard to think about behavior, that is, functions/practices/cultures/ways of working. It seems that therefore we should first talk about roles (this is easier), and then discuss their methods of work (this is more difficult)! But “first roles, then what they do”—this turns out to be incorrect in projects. Roles appear in reasoning much later, and we will repeat this once again (this sequence of thinking needs to be repeated, repeated, repeated not only in the course but also in life: this is the **“mantra of systems thinking”**):

-   **What needs to be changed in the environment of the target system.** First, we need to understand what changes are needed in the environment of the target system. If you remove the target system from the world, break it—what will everyone cry about? If no one notices, then immediately stop the project of creating and developing the system, it is not needed, it does not change anything in the surrounding world when it is used (the fact that its creators will not receive salaries is an excuse. They will not bring irreparable benefit by creating the system, the world will not improve from the creation of the system, so creators should not be paid for a system that does not change the environment, unless as charity. If this is not obvious and conscious charity, then the creators' demand for resources for work that is unnecessary for anyone but them is insolence and fraud).
-   **By what means/method are we changing the environment** **of the target system.** Next, we need to choose the means by which the system changes this world, the function/method of the system’s operation. This is the examination of behavior that should occur at the moment of using the system with some role objects to bring about the changes in the environment specified in the previous point. Here are different calculations related to the moment of use (what flows at the moment of use, what energy is needed, how much time it will take, etc.).
-   **What is the role of the target system.** Only here can you say what name is culturally accepted for target systems performing such functions—say the role of the target system. **The role of the target system only here!**
-   **What will we make the target system from.** Then choose the affordances for the target system (and since systems have many systemic levels, it often comes down to choosing affordances for well-identified subsystems). This is an inventive task, pure creativity.
-   **By what methods of work do we make the target system.** Then we need to understand by what methods we should work with these constructs/materials so that the target system can function properly. Should we use welding, training, laser cutting, teambuilding?
-   **What is the role of the creator.** After identifying what is needed and how to do it, we need to ask about the role of the creator who will do this with the constructs-affordances, ultimately turning them into a functioning/used system. Choose a culturally-defined role name, refer to a textbook for the agent (or at least articles, posts by specialists on methods of the role), who will be the construct-affordance for the role. **The role of the creator only at this step!**
-   **Who/what will be the creator.** Only after this do we take the constructs for potential creators (people, equipment, AI agents, enterprises) and select affordances/fit ones that will be able to perform the roles from the previous point. For we must always beware of choosing a baker from skilled shoemakers.

Of course, going through these steps is not like a "waterfall/cascade" that always falls down and never goes back. No, at each step, hypotheses are made, which are criticized, experiments conducted with them (the usual course of knowledge!), and if these hypotheses are refuted, it is necessary to return to the previous steps, often to the very beginning: understanding why the created and developed system is needed at all. But the logical sequence of steps is as written. Of course, in life, we have to solve reverse problems as well, "here we have people Petya and Vasya who can start a fire by friction. How can we adapt them to the business so that they at least feed themselves today?" Or "here our scientists have invented a sepulka. Where could we stick it so that people would pay us for its mass production?" But these are not direct, but reverse problems—their solutions are interesting, but it's still better to solve the direct problem in each project.

Another difficulty is that creators can "create creators" (for example, people-founders of an enterprise can create an enterprise, and the enterprise will create the target system). But this is just sequential utilization of these considerations in some chains or even graphs of system creation.

The main problem here is that this logical sequence of steps of system reasoning is rarely followed in work projects. Most students of previous versions of our course demonstrated knowledge of this reasoning in conversations detached from the work project, but its non-application in their real projects—it was necessary to conduct training (repetition, repetition, repetition of reasoning for the real project, training the neural network in the student's brain by multiple repetitions of the pattern) so that this reasoning would not remain "reasoning from the textbook," but become a purposeful method of thinking, consciously and constantly used in work projects.
