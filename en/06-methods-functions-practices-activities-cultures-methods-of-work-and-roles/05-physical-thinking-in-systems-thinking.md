title: Physical Thinking in Systems Thinking
---

In systems thinking, most often (alas, this is true) "Aristotelian physics" is used: when a finger presses on a table, but the table does not press on the finger because the finger is alive and active, while the table is passive! In systems thinking, the system as a role-playing object "plays its role"::behavior, i.e., it functions, performs its function---but is considered active and changing the world around it without significant changes to its states (at least---without destruction during work, being steady), while systems in the environment are considered primarily passive, undergoing changes and significantly altering their states, sometimes to the point of destruction.

Changes in the states of the system while performing its function are considered later, separately. This approach is also used in modern physics. For example, in constructor theory, a creator is defined as one who changes its environment an unlimited number of times without its own degradation (and they cite an example of a catalyst molecule, which produces catalysis but remains unchanged after each act, and a self-replicating robot, which remains unchanged after each replication act)^[https://www.constructortheory.org/].

The stability of some systems in a chaotic environment that interacts with them is a subject of close study by physicists. Atoms are very stable, molecules are also stable, as well as life forms. The boundaries of systems are often drawn along the lines of stable existence, non-destruction during use. In physics, this is a non-equilibrium steady state, NESS (non-equilibrium steady state), which is actively studied in the 21st century: in contrast to equilibrium, which requires no energy and work to sustain, energy and work are involved to sustain a non-equilibrium state, which generally maintains this state. Imagine a tightrope walker maintaining balance in the wind---this is it. On one side, many small state changes in the target system, and on the other---no catastrophe, sharp state changes, or system destruction. Stability to external impacts consists in constant changes, adjustments, paradoxically. Although NESS was initially studied on simple systems in physics, this thesis was picked up by chemists^[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp061858z], and later by biologists^[https://physicallensonthecell.org/chemical-physics/non-equilibrium-steady-states], but it concerns the general description of some systems that "balance" around some state, remaining "almost the same" under fairly sharp environmental changes.

The idea of a creator/constructor is that it is a universal transformer of matter/things much like a computer is a universal calculator if it is equivalent to a universal Turing machine^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40CB12cj_aM], only these transformations of the environment according to some algorithm/theory for a universal creator are limited not only by calculations but also by changes in the physical world---the universality is that potentially any transformations (transformations) permitted by physical laws are possible. And the universal creator after each transformation is ready for the next---it does not lose its stability, actively "balances" in interaction with the environment, "microfluctuates" compared to macrofluctuations, where identity is lost (e.g., destruction occurs). The "universal creator" can, of course, create new tools as a method step, and even a copy of itself ("army of clones").

A person (or a sufficiently advanced robot) in this physical theory is just such an example of a universal creator: it can acquire knowledge/theories/disciplines/algorithms from its interactions with the environment (conduct research), create tools from the surrounding matter and thereby enhance its ability to transform the world, it can self-replicates (have children).

Creators from the systems approach are most often universal creators, but all other systems (which maintain stability, leading to changes around them), and a simple machine (processing multiple parts according to an algorithm, while remaining a machine, stable in maintaining its shape in space-time, retaining the boundary with the environment, not mixing with it) or computer (producing multiple calculations as physical processes, retaining its shape, not mixing with the environment), are creators. But both a person and an AI agent in a robot (the exit into transformation of the surrounding world is essential, it is impossible to limit oneself only to calculations/thinking, i.e., it is impossible to limit oneself only to work with information) and even a large organization performing various projects for many years---all these are creators, only in the case of people, AI agents, and organizations these are universal creators: potentially they can carry out any (even unknown at the moment) transformations of the physical world if they are not prohibited by physical laws.

The main question thus becomes whether some action, the creation of some system, or the transition of a system into some state is in principle/theoretically possible by the principles of physics or impossible. If possible, then potentially we can make such a transformation if only we have the right knowledge---i.e., we can develop a method. What about the resources for such a transformation? If we have the knowledge, we can obtain the resources!

So in systems thinking, words about the "interaction" of parts of a system are used, but in fact, each time it is not "mutual" but simply "action": a pair of some active system-creator and more or less passive environment. Why is this so?

We remember that systems thinking is about managing the attention of universal creators who realize universal calculations and universal transformations (people, AI agents, organized/collective intelligences). In the thinking of these agents, saying that "everything is connected with everything else" and "everything interacts with everything else" and "everything affects and mutually influences everything" is not very correct^[See the concept of small-world networks and examples including non-small-world networks, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network]. It is more useful to attract attention to a central object, anchor one camera of attention on it, and then consider everything else with other cameras in relation to this anchored object.

If there are many agents, then it is possible to divide overall thinking among several agents (or in other words---federate the thinking of several agents into a single holistic reasoning) if the agents communicate with each other, exchanging the results of measurements and reflections^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763423004694]. Systems thinking is exactly for such work, helping to federate (i.e., unite disparate objects) the information of different agent-creators.

Modeling is primarily about compressing information; a model does not contain all the information about an object but only the most important about what is being modeled for the object. For example, mechanical models contain information about the motion of physical bodies but not the color of these bodies. Operational management models contain information about work speed but not about the workers' clothes or the language of communication. Systems modeling, based on functional (time of operation of the system considered as a role, by the changes in the states of its environment)---is essentially a move towards information compression, highlighting the important. Of course, for different agents involved in the project to create some target system, the important appears different. Someone is concerned with taste, someone with color, someone (we write "someone" because agents are mostly living today, but this is not necessary), and someone with cost.

The target system as a role/functional object that plays a role/performs a function (or for agents---works by the method) in its environment---this is the answer to the requirement for a center of attention in the course of systems reasoning. If it becomes clear what the system will do, it also becomes clear what it should be created from. If it is clear what to create from, it is also clear how to create this system, "what needs to be done". If it is understandable what to do, it becomes clear who can do it and what will be needed for this. In the previous phrase, "he" may refer to the **extended** **enterprise** as the creator, i.e., a union of various enterprises by some contracts to carry out a large complex project. And since enterprises are made from universal creator-people and AI agents (primarily robots, because we need an exit into changes to the physical world, 4E cognition), the same enterprises can produce/create and develop very different kinds of target systems depending on the accessibility of knowledge/algorithm/discipline of the method of how to do it (including knowledge of how to obtain the necessary resource tools and estimate the required time, and also to survive and not be destroyed during work).

Methods and systems working by them (as role objects) are very often considered exactly this way: system-creator::"role object" acts on the materials of the system being created (in the end, these materials will become the target system, and the target system itself will start to work), and the system being created is just another role object. Rebound action (of the target system during its creation on its creators) is neglected, but if it is really important, they conduct another consideration specifically to account for this action.

If a tool cuts a part, it blunts. This is neglected, and the changes to the part are studied, it is essential! The role action of the tool alters the shape of the part (converting the state of the metal part from "workpiece in the machine" to "part in the machine")! And then a separate consideration talks about what happens to the tool. But then they also call the part "a blunting medium", not a part. Another role of the same physical object---a piece of metal!

In some way, this is **panpsychism**---a convenient way to think of inanimate objects as if they were alive. In panpsychism, which, besides **animism** as a belief in spirits dwelling in all objects, has other variations, for example, **minimal physicalism**^[https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2021/2/niab013/6334115], which does not propose the existence of living beings other than following the most basic laws of physics (e.g., understanding that living beings are creators/constructors who can only perform those transformations of the world around that are allowed by physical laws and nothing supernatural). We will adhere to panpsychism precisely in the version of minimal physicalism. And further conversation will be in terms of the physics of creators, somewhat similar to Aristotelian physics, where participants of the action are divided into "active" and "passive" objects, like "a hammer hits a nail." This way of thinking has its limitations, but it is at least necessary to recognize and understand what is being discussed in such cases, as well as to understand such descriptions.

Strangely, panpsychism as a way of thinking about everything as somewhat alive (but without animism! No "spirits of things", no "feelings of the stool one sits on"!) turns out to be quite modern. Thus, one molecule can very well be a witness/observer of another molecule, i.e., "measure" it, interact with it, and thus solve the "observer" problem in physics.

One molecule is clearly not yet a living "observer," but it is quite "alive" in the sense of panpsychism in the version of minimal physicalism. In panpsychism as minimal physicalism, "life" itself is defined by physical principles and laws, as the ability of some creators to self-replicate. The approach to the universality of the creator, i.e., the potential ability to perform any transformations not only of information, as in the case of a universal Turing machine but also of matter, is associated with intelligence and consciousness.

Since physics deals with the concept of "observer," let's look at it as a system-observer, i.e., a system in the role of an observer, or "observer"::system::role. If the "observer" is a role, there must be a method/culture of observation, and it should start from the method to understand what (or who) can perform the work by this method, not the other way around, starting from the "observer" and coming to a misunderstanding, what method will conduct this observation. The method/way/style of observation for the role of the observer can vary greatly, and in physics, it is currently reduced to measurement as obtaining information about the environment. So, if we consider the interaction of a molecule with the environment as obtaining information by it, this is the "molecule-observer." That's all, no "human-observer" is needed, not even an "observing robot." It is enough to consider the interaction as facts of measurement, i.e., obtaining information. The whole physics, which deals with interactions of objects of the surrounding world, thereby becomes informational physics, because everything becomes expressible in terms of information.

Quantum physicists love such a method/way/culture of thinking [from "Minimal physicalism as a scale-free substrate for cognition and consciousness", 2021, by Chris Fields, James F. Glazebrook, and Michael Levin https://chrisfieldsresearch.com/min-phys-NC-2021.pdf and more works about "no, it's not solipsism! just physicists didn't understand what they've been doing for many years!" from there the phrase "information can only be obtained by intervention, i.e., by actively posing a question (see Mermin 2018; Mueller 2020) for recent, somewhat philosophical discussions": "Making better sense of quantum mechanics", 2018, by N. David Mermin, https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01639 (it was Mermin who said about the interpretation of quantum mechanics as "Shut up and calculate!", not Feynman first said, https://www.lassp.cornell.edu/mermin/), and also "Law without law: from observer states to physics via algorithmic information theory", 2017, by Markus P. Mueller, https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01826 (here are the author's publications---http://www.mpmueller.net/research.html).], and astrophysicists who work at a completely different scale also adhere to such reasoning (and Earth is somewhat "alive" in a sense^[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/intelligence-as-a-planetary-scale-process/5077C784D7FAC55F96072F7A7772C5E5]). And it is necessary to say here that all phenomena "only of the living, but not of the undead" like "consciousness" also turn out in such a version of panpsychism-minimal physicalism reinterpreted anew [Here we can highlight a consciousness theory supporting such an approach: IIT, integrated information theory, http://integratedinformationtheory.org/] and one can speak to some extent about the consciousness of a bacterium (although very small), and about the consciousness of an ant colony^[https://philpapers.org/archive/FRITAC-4.pdf], and even about the consciousness of Earth, as in the work of the mentioned astrophysicists---and, without any esotericism, exclusively within the framework of physics laws!

One example of such an approach of indistinction between the living and non-living (when "function" and "role" are employed for agents in a broad sense, not only in the narrow sense of "intellectual conscious agents") is the engineering method of developing a **Use Case** "usage scenarios"^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case]. In English it's use case, but in Swedish, the language in which Ivar Jacobson proposed the method of use case scenarios in 1986, instead of the word case/"legal case"/"case history"/"practice variant" the word "scenario" was used.

**Use Case** defines the interaction between active external **actors** trying to achieve their goals and the target system. Actors in use cases (in other methods, the term actor/actuator/actor might mean something completely different! Here we discuss only the method of creating a **Use case** system through use case scenarios) are functional/role objects, which are not necessarily realized by humans: they can be implemented/embodied in the physical world by people, a company or just an organizational unit, some equipment, a computer program including universal (AI). When analyzing the interaction of external actors and the system as use cases, it is easy to "identify requirements," and the approach gained broad recognition in requirement engineering. Somewhere from 2015-2017, requirements ceased to be developed (this will be detailed in the "Systems Engineering" course), but for modeling the functioning/usage/operationof the system in its external world (environment), one continues to engage in the method of describing this functioning through use case scenarios.

Here is a typical use case diagram^[http://www.uml-diagrams.org/examples/online-shopping-use-case-diagram-example.html] (the example emphasizes that not all actors in these diagrams are people; see the example description in the article via the provided link):

Use case scenarios proved very successful for describing system functioning/processes/sequences\_actions/scenarios/behavior and its parts. This way of description became ubiquitous for engineers, leading to the creation of functional/role descriptions. Note that the change in system states in the use concept is hard to express, but it is clear "what affects what" during functioning, who are the participants of interactions, and what surrounds the target system.
