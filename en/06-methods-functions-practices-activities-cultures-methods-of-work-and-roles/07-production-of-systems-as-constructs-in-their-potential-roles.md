title: Production of Systems as Constructs in Their Potential Roles
---

Even highly intelligent system creators usually do not assign
functions of arbitrary kinds to themselves; they take functions "seen"
from culture --- these are behavior patterns, so repeatability is important
(a pattern is observed in a series of behaviors, it's a "template"). So,
method/way/practice/function reflects in some sense
"uniformity"/template/similarity, following one
style/culture/method of behaviors. And after that, roughly the same can be said
about the role. Then, either such a term for a function as behavior already exists in the language
(heating --- heater), or it doesn't, in which case it has to be
invented (sepuling --- sepulka).

The hammer did not assign itself the role of nail driver, nor does it have
the function of driving nails. We can take a microscope and assign it
as a "hammer" --- to drive nails with it. "Hammer" in this case is nothing more than
a role term for the microscope::construct (or stone::construct, or
even hammer::construct), the name should not confuse. The behavior
of the microscope in this named role, its function, "playing the role of a driver"
--- driving nails. If "driving nails" refers not to
the microscope but to Vasya-with-the-microscope, then "driving nails" is often not called a "function" but a "method/practice/way/culture of work," 
"a type of labor/activity/variant/kind of engineering". With
functions/methods and the roles performing them, there can be many "almost
synonyms" even in the names of types, you must have noticed them already; we
tried to use many synonymic series in the course for
culture/style/type of labor/method/way of work (but not the work itself! In
the course "Methodology," the difference will be explained: works imply 
a resource-based view "who works on what when," and methods/ways
of work --- a substantive, "how to do all this, regardless of when and with
which exactly instances of objects").

One can say "the culture of driving nails," why not --- although
driving nails is not usually talked about this way, they will discuss "the method of work".
But some "dancing tango" easily can be called a culture or
a style of dancing, but rarely "a method of work" or even "type of labor".
The main thing is to understand that "dancing tango" and "driving nails"
are objects of the same type: function/method/culture of the working behavior of a dancer and
"function/method/culture" of the working behavior of a carpenter). The synonymy of the functions
of driving nails for a carpenter-with-a-tool and
hammer-or-microscope-without-a-carpenter (a tool and an agent-with-a-tool
seem to perform the same function, but in fact their roles and functions
differ) --- this synonymy will also have to be somehow removed. In large
projects with naming thousands and thousands of roles and functions/methods, there can
be huge confusion, especially since a hammer or a microscope might now 
turn out to have artificial intelligence, and this will further
confuse understanding others and choosing one's own terms.

Why is it important to take culturally prescribed terms rather than invent
them on one's own by occasion? For example, calling Vasya in the role of an engineer
an engineer, and not "a life improver" or "a creator of successful systems"?
First of all, it’s a matter of understanding: you won’t need to explain in detail
what Vasya does as an engineer, you can reference the culture
(that is, suggest to "Google" or ask an AI assistant). Interestingly, textbooks (or
regulations, instructions, international and industry standards) on work methods might
surface, which you didn’t know about. Read them, our
students were surprised to learn that many of their work problems were described in
textbooks, as well as ways to solve these problems --- they just
didn’t realize that their work wasn’t unique, many people on
the planet have been engaged and are engaged in this work, so there are patterns
(methods/practices/cultures/styles) of work that can be followed to
work in a certain role with fewer problems. Solving tasks (when it's clear what to do, and you only
need to gather resources and perform the work according to the known method) is much simpler than overcoming problems (when it's not clear at all what's happening and what to do --- but further work somehow doesn't proceed).

So, try not to invent terminological bicycles and not
to invent work methods on your own and not to redefine
culturally prescribed roles. Of course, everything written in
textbooks/instructions/standards needs to be adapted to work situations,
but still, it is better to reach actual problems along the rails of 
someone else's explanations for certain work methods, 
used by already existing roles, before adapting them. Or, be prepared to face beginner's mistakes. 
You can, of course, spend a huge amount of time learning 
to play a DJ console through trial and error, but going to DJ school 
or at least taking a DJ course through self-tutorials is a significantly shorter path. This reasoning also applies to management work methods and manager roles,
although it is somehow less understood. "Can you play the violin? No, but I think I can" --- this joke
turns out to be common thinking in management. A qualified agent, who has mastered
the craft of a thermal technician engineer or even an HR problem engineer, goes into operational management
--- knowing nothing about this culture, although there are many textbooks on the subject. 
And the result --- a huge number of managerial mistakes, the "invention of clumsy bicycles". Therefore, remember: **behind every**
**method/practice/culture** **of work, activity/type of labor/engineering** **there is a textbook**
**(often in the form of a regulation, instruction, corporate standard, online course, etc.), and** **by signing on to a role in a project**
**you should at least flip through such a textbook** **for your method** (unless you work at such a frontier where this method needs to be created, in which case you will write such a textbook yourself for those who follow in your footsteps, for example, your employees).

If the terminology with the "function" is chosen, then the function is performed by the role/
"a functional object"/"a physical object as a role". Or, the same thing, just in different words: role behavior is performed
by the activity role (method/practice/function --- this is "role
behavior", you must recognize in "role behavior" a mention of
method/way/practice/culture/style/work method). Or
a functional "object" suddenly gets called a functional "element", 
ignoring that "element" means something indivisible further into parts. Or in an organization, 
they will not use terms from the textbook/standard method "configuration management for
mechanical production", but instead for their products, they will
talk about "the working process of completing" --- and it will turn out to be the same as
"configuration management"::method, only some problems
from the textbook/standard "configuration management" are not
noticed, and all the terminology is thought up on the spot, 
not taken from the literature. Naturally, problems can be expected: it would be good to understand
where those discrepancies with the textbook method come from and what to do with
the problems that no one has noticed yet, but which will certainly soon
manifest themselves --- and they would be better prevented.

Words-terms are both important and unimportant! Just try each time to understand,
what kind of concept is indicated by the term --- and from which
discipline/theory/knowledge of which method is this concept, which variant/type
of the general method uses exactly this term.

**Knowledge/explanations** **are transferred from situation to situation in the form**
**of descriptions** **in textbooks, corporate regulations, industrial standards**
**"normative work methods"/"norms** **of culture"/"norms** **of behavior"::"prescribed**
**behavior patterns"** **for** systems::roles/"functional objects"** (system runtime in its
role), not norms of behavior for various** **constructive/material
objects, chosen by affordances for performing the role** **(creation and development time of the system, runtime of creators).**

But if you are a manufacturer of constructs and expect that they will somehow
be used (that is, they are used as affordance for some
systems::role), how do you name these objects? Say, you produce a pump. And
the customer chooses from different affordances of changing water pressure: buy
your pump or use a water tower and pipes (and then the pump for the tower will be completely different)?

In case of producing some "potential affordances", you can
use the technique where the target systems are named by the role of their
main method of work if it is an "animated agent", or main
function if it is something not very intelligent (for the pump --- named by
its suction function, for the compressor --- by the function
"compressing/compressing the gas", etc.). Systems are primarily
considered as role/functional objects at the moment when they perform their role, that is, they are ready and
functioning/functioning/being used, bringing benefit, by changing in the process of
their work their working/operational environment/environment.

For the customer, your "pump"::"main expected role" can easily be
called "the antifreeze pusher in the second cooling loop"::role, if the role
assignment/function --- pushing antifreeze in the second loop. The pump factory sells "the pump", but the engineer who bought the pump
(also can be an enterprise! "Engineer" --- this is a role that can be
played by an entire enterprise!) --- renames it briefly "pusher", and
that’s normal. **Systems thinking allows not getting confused with different
names of the same system, moreover, for manufacturers
of constructs of subsystems and creators of target systems, these names are different, this is a typical situation.**

Outside the context of using engineering abilities, Masha is simply
Masha::"agent in the narrow sense"/"almost universal creator". Masha can be many things, like a microscope that can
show small objects, but can also be used to crack nuts, drive nails, be used as a paperweight. Masha can do many things, much more than a microscope! But at the moment
of performing the function of an engineer ("Masha-construct plays the role of an engineer"),
Masha will be called by the role --- "engineer". And that’s normal, although we would
immediately require clarification for such cases (refrigeration engineer, electronic engineer, software engineer
--- these are very different engineers. And you must definitely specify the method that Masha
is engaged in as an engineer: which specific type of engineering this is, the more specialization can be determined, the better).

**Systems are usually named by** **their roles, defined by** **their primary** **purpose, that is, by**
**their most frequently performed function, what they do in the surrounding world. Imagine there is no target system** **--- what important would not happen if it is removed from the world,
if it does not work? What** **roles** **in the current culture** **usually perform this**
**"important action, impossible without the removed system"? Name the system this way.**

When we name the microscope, we primarily mean that it allows "seeing small"
at the moment when it is fully manufactured and works. If we thought that the microscope's main purpose was to hit something (nuts, for example), we would call it a "crusher".

As in any language, the oldest names have unclear origins and often refer to form (hammer, little hammer --- but the hammer itself is from the method
of threshing/beating-free
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshing)]
beating, based on the verb "to thresh", that is "to beat") or something else.
But if we are developing systems or want to understand something about systems,
then in the name we should look for not the constructive/material object
representing the system, but the role --- and the indication of the function/actions of this role.

But if the system is suddenly a human or AI-agent, or moreover
an organization of people, AI-agents, and various equipment, usually very little can be immediately said about the purpose/function of such a system in its
environment, for with intelligent agents as universal
creators, everything is usually complicated. And with the role behavior/functions of people and
universal AI-agents, you will always have to deal separately and
specifically. But **thinking about people-or-AI-in-role and** **some**
**microscope-in-role will be arranged in the same way!**
