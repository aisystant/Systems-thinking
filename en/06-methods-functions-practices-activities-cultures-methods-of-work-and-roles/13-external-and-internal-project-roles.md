title: External and Internal Project Roles
---

"Say 'system' --- I mean the presence of creators::system and their project roles that create this system, and creators::system creating this system as part of some supersystems. Say project role --- I mean the system that is being created or operated by this role" --- this is the very basics of systems thinking (system in its environment) at its intersection with methodology (system-creator, "working by some method"/"in some way"/"in some style"). We can specify further which exact systems (target systems, creators somewhere in the creation chain, supersystems, subsystems), which system creation projects have to be considered, but this does not change the essence of the reasoning.

A project role (performed by an agent-construct for this role) logically appears in this reasoning before the system: if there is no agent playing some role to achieve its intention, then there is no one to highlight the system with their attention from the objects of the surrounding world. Conversely, if the system is highlighted as an object from the diversity of surrounding objects, then for what and who outlined its boundaries in the world this way and not otherwise? Why was they interested in the system at all, what system characteristics are important to such an agent, for invoking what method in whose role of this agent?

Of course, project roles are not played by just any people/agents/actors for whom the system is just "interesting" or "curious" (as observers, but without the desire to lift a finger later). No, project roles are those who will, in principle, act in the physical world if they need this system (or conversely, it interferes with some of its characteristics). These roles are performed by real agents (people, organizations, AI agents) ultimately changing the physical world, and not just the "world of imagination"/"mental world"/"world of descriptions". Just as an "observer" in commonly understood physics does not change the world, he is not an actor/practitioner, so other "observing onlookers" --- these are not project roles, they are just passersby, they do not need to be made objects of attention in the project. Project roles are "acting figures", they come alive when played by actors as "performers"! And they affect the target systems and systems of creation, whose important characteristics they are interested in. They must be identified in the project and kept in focus during the reasoning about the system and the project of its creation.

Dogs bark, but the caravan moves on: the dogs here are not project roles, they do not affect the caravan. But if the merchant does not pay for the passage of the caravan, the caravan will not move on. The merchant is a project role; he takes an active/operational position concerning the caravan. Passing agents --- these are not agents with project roles. Project roles are agents who will not pass by, these are agents whose roles the project will necessarily hook or who will necessarily hook the project.

Usually, many projects are associated with a system, it does not have to be just one project in the sense of classical project management, i.e., the work of one team. In one project of one team, the system can be conceived, in another --- designed, in the third --- manufactured, in the fourth --- operated, then resold, in the fifth --- continue operating, then in the sixth --- modernized, in the seventh --- continue operating, in the eighth --- decommissioned, but then still discover that the system development project needs to continue --- and a ninth project appears. A project role can be in any of these projects, for example, we already consider the project roles of people who will later operate the system when conceiving and creating it: roles and subroles of operators, roles, and types of system users roles. If we make a video game, we consider the player's role immediately, although there may still be many years before the game's release --- and it is unclear who exactly (which agent) will play this role, and there may later be millions of players.

In systems thinking, we regularly think about the future "as if it already exists," which is normal for 4D extensionalism. Saying "I don't know what the system will be because the system is not there yet" is an ignorance of human engineering experience. **All system creation projects start with the system not yet existing, but already being considered!**

Thinking about how (methods/"types of labor"/"work processes") and by whom (what roles, actors in which roles) the system, barely conceived in its MVP, will be operated --- not only is it normal, it is simply necessary, this is where you should start thinking about the system! If there is no one who needs or operates/uses the system, then why make it at all?!

And if it will be operated, then by whom, what project roles, who needs it, and what important characteristics does it have for them? The identity of the role performer (which specific agent will play the role) is not needed, it is not so important here, but the role itself must be specified! Simply put, you need to describe everything about Prince Hamlet in the play or a hobbit in a role-playing game even before the play or the gaming event itself, and it does not matter who exactly will later perform this role ("performer"), the character traits of the actor or player, and not "acting role"::role. The role is much more important than its performer. Although the skill of the role performer is important, yes. But it would be worse if it were a skillful performance of a completely different role! Remember the joke about the pigeon, speech therapist, gastroenterologist: we cannot even understand the appropriateness of an agent in the project if it is unknown what the agent should do, i.e., the method of work is unknown and therefore the agent's role is unknown.

System creation and development projects are usually collective projects, and in these projects, agreements about systems are usually made to best meet the interests of project roles.

**System boundary** --- this is the boundary of the place in the physical world occupied by the system at the time of operation/use/functioning. The system boundary determines which parts are included in the system (and therefore need to be designed and manufactured in the system creation and development project), and which are not included in the system but are included in the surrounding systems (and therefore can be expected to be already deployed by other agents not included in the project team).

This system boundary is primarily determined by the team of agents (people or even enterprises with all their computers and factory equipment) playing the project roles of system creators. The best culturally determined understanding of the composition of project roles is given in the course "Systems Engineering." There they talk about the roles of visionary, developer, architect, creator of the internal engineering platform --- and each role has methods they use in their work. Of course, different types of systems (hardware, software, organisms, individuals, organizations, communities) use different types/variants of systems creation and development methods, so the roles differ. For example, for creating mastery::system, culture creators, methodologists, methodists, teachers are needed, and also a dean's office.

**Internal project roles** --- these are the project roles played by the **project team**, and **external roles** --- all others, primarily concerning external systems relative to the boundary of the target system, i.e., systems in the working/operational environment of the target system and systems in the graph of the target system creation. For instance, external project roles may be in the project of creating the interior, which includes decorative clocks, and internal project roles - in the project of creating the clocks themselves. External project roles in the marketing department can create a clientele for the decorative clock creation project --- bringing teams of various interior developers.

In English literature, the term stakeholder is often used for an external project role (and in Russian --- the calque "stakeholder"), but be careful:

-   Sometimes stakeholder means only an external role, sometimes --- any project role.
-   Sometimes stakeholder specifically means the role, but often --- the agent-performer of the role, i.e., confusing Vasya Pupkin with the Prince Hamlet he plays. Sometimes they specify: stakeholder and stakeholder role, sometimes for the role performer stakeholder representative, especially when there are many role performers, e.g., there are 1000 users of a device, thus the person responsible for expressing the users' interests will be called a stakeholder representative. But often no clarifications are made, and then Prince Hamlet is asked how he slept between performances, and Vasya Pupkin is asked what he thinks of "To be, or not to be, that is the question!". This confusion with the concept of stakeholder is very common, so in our course, we avoid this synonym for project role.

The project team determines what (which parts) are needed in the target system and what (which parts) are not needed in its composition so that the system can fulfill its role/function/purpose in the environment and not cost prohibitively (more than external roles can pay for its creation), and then manufactures these parts and sets up the combined work of the manufactured parts. And external project roles determine the system's functions/purpose in its environment. Usually, your external project roles are some project roles within the client organization, but there are roles "without organization" (e.g., a computer game player, or a lone hacker, they are here on their own) and roles from other organizations (e.g., "security officer" from some state oversight). You can, of course, rename them as you like, but we do not recommend doing so, i.e., it is recommended not to rename the roles "financier," "developer," "security officer" in the client organization as one role "user" in your project. It is correct to leave it as "financier," "client developer," "client security officer" (this distinguishes him from the "state oversight security officer"). And remember that besides the roles in the client organization, many other roles should be considered in the project --- regulators, representatives of the general public, and even hackers, thieves, terrorists, and other malefactors (their interests should also be considered, but inversely: so they cannot achieve their goals).

All performing these internal and external project roles people/organizations/agents/actors/org units (even if each org unit plays several roles or several org units play one role) show resourcefulness and inventiveness in satisfying their interests --- each based on their agency intentions, occupying some project roles (also in different projects), and agreeing on important/interesting characteristics of the system and the project of its creation and/or operation for their working methods.

**System in the eyes of the beholder**: if no one::role observes, i.e., if for no one's working method the system is needed, then there is no system, no boundary, no assigned/role behavior/function. **The system is subjective** **and exists** **as an object of attention only** **within the agreements** **of a specific project**. An engineering project exists as continuous negotiations of internal project roles, as well as internal and external project roles regarding reaching an agreement on what system project participants are making and how this system, by operating, satisfies the interests of external project roles. It does not matter that agents performing roles change during the project: Vasya-engineer quit, Masha-engineer replaced him, everything continues. And the project description in terms of engineering methods of work and the engineer's role description remains unchanged regardless of the construct change.

Some agents in some roles agree on the boundaries of the system as "A and B are included, C is not included," while in other roles in the same project, or in another project, the same people/org units/actors/agents can quite highlight the system from the surrounding world with their attention within other boundaries, "A and C are included, B is not included," and also demand other values for the important characteristics of the system if this better meets their interests in those roles. **And this is normal, there are no contradictions here; this is** **simply the initial stage of collective activity:** **all project roles need to agree** **on what the system is that we conceive, create, operate, modify,** **decommission.** **And since** **all project circumstances continuously change during the project, it's impossible to agree "once and for all," there must be continuous agreements!** **Agreeing** **on accounting for their interests, including the question of what the system being created and developed in the project** **actually is,** **will have to be done by roles,** **even performed by one person-actor. Since there are always many roles, it will be necessary to make decisions regularly to reconcile these roles' interests regarding important matters of interest/characteristics of the system and** **the specifics of conducting** **the project** **on creating and developing the system.**

No appeals to "objectivity" will help here, agreements must be made considering that subjects of interest for project roles are usually common, but preferences in characteristics values are different. One needs the system to travel faster (characteristic: speed, preference: faster), while the other needs the system to be lighter (characteristic: weight, preference: lighter). The first, to satisfy his interest, plans to equip the system with a powerful battery, which has a lot of weight --- and the second realizes that he needs to act urgently to prevent this! They immediately start negotiating. All projects are continuous negotiations of different roles with each other. Roles, so eliminating particularly obstinate employees often does not help: the kindest employees take on the role of the fired project member --- and it turns out that nothing has changed, the role interests still need to be considered (the interests of Prince Hamlet, not Vasya or Petya who play the role).

Disagreed --- and the project immediately falls apart. Agreed --- and the project is successful (remember that a successful system is defined as "everyone agreed on this system").

**System success today is determined not** **"objectively,"** **but subjectively ---** **by satisfying the needs (needs)** **of customers, users, and** **various** **other** **project roles, including agreeing with them the internal roles of the project**^[<http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Systems_Engineering_Overview> --- Systems engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems. Successful systems must satisfy the needs of their customers, users and other stakeholders.]. Agents (people and also AI agents and their various organizations), playing various roles concerning the system and the project of its creation, must be satisfied --- success in this. One cannot determine the success of the system by looking only at the system itself. Both the system (its boundaries!) and its success --- are in the eyes of the beholder. Different agents and even the same agents (in different project roles!) can have different opinions about the system's success. So the task of creating the system above all --- is to agree between the project roles (it will look like the agreements of role performers: "Masha agreed with Sasha," but it should be understood correctly that it is "engineer agreed with manager," it is preferable to discuss this in roles, not faces). The task here is to propose such a system or a working method about which they will not need to negotiate, for it will immediately implement all roles' preferences.

The systems approach, systems thinking, starting from the second generation --- is also about agents creating systems in their various roles concerning the system, and not just about the system being created. The system is created as a result of all these agents' agreements. Agents' behavior in systems creation and development projects is not arbitrary but patterned/templated, determined by their culturally determined (most often understood as "profession") role.

**The only option** **for "objectivity"** **---** **is well-organized subjectivity**^[Statement by G.P. Shchedrovitsky.], when all project roles (external and team) agree on what their system is and what they will get from it.

If some project role is forgotten, not accounted for, or someone who plays that role is forgotten when creating the system --- there won't be a successful system: some parts of the system will not be discovered, designed, or manufactured, and some needed work for the system's success will not be done, and this will be found out after the project fails.

Project failure (that someone's interests are not taken into account) is bound to be discovered: this dissatisfied "someone in the role" is not just an observer; he is an actor! Some agent (one person or a huge organization), whose work by the method of his role is affected by the system or the project of its creation and development, will actively and inventively play this role forgotten by the project team, and his actions will become quite noticeable to the project team. Even if this is "nobody and his name is nobody," a role performer with unaccounted interests can find influential friends or organize a press campaign: ignoring the agent-in-role is usually impossible, agents are extremely inventive and may also switch their roles to achieve the satisfaction of some role interest.

Join some business game where you need to improvise while sticking to roles --- you will be surprised by your inventiveness. In life, it's all the same, only unlike the game, it is not paid attention to: roles are played unconsciously, but in vain! If you understand that you are playing a role, the inventiveness of "playing by role," the inventiveness of "actor's etudes" can be targeted and consciously invoked --- and it usually greatly contributes to success.
