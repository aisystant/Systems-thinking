title: Descriptions
---

But why do we need descriptions, mental/ideal objects?! We will be primarily interested in:

-   Symbolic/sign/linguistic descriptions as opposed to connectionist/neural network ones. We need collective development, meaning access for multiple agents to one description for both editing and familiarization. **Symbolic descriptions are easy to alienate** **(document), copy, and transfer in the course of collective development**. A description within an agent's neural network is hard to alienate—there instead of "copying, transferring," "learning" works, a completely different mechanism of description transfer.
-   Descriptions within the framework of theoretical concept theory (theory theory, objects and relations, the work of slow thinking S2), not prototype concept theory (prototype theory, work with metaphors and analogies, concept blending, the work of fast thinking S1). **The formality of the description** **is needed** **to facilitate verification.**

We need to document descriptions for (collectively arranged) thinking: they help keep attention on important objects in the physical world (the document/external memory keeps the focus of various system creators on the objects we described in it). These documented descriptions can also be used to transfer experience from one system creation project to others if they describe not instances of the system but their type (a set of a certain kind/type of system). If you've created an informational model of a stool, it will be an informational model of not just one stool; you can make a dozen stools from this informational model and use them in ten different projects.

When people say "description," they usually mean "documented description" and even "document with a description." But be careful: sometimes "description" doesn't mean it's documented; sometimes a description exists (a concept, a mental object), but a document with this description (a physical object) doesn't. **When you hear "description," determine from the context what is meant: the actual description, or the document with the description.** In our course, we will also use "description" to refer to a "document with a description." But you must clearly distinguish between a description (a mental object), a document with a description (a physical object, usually with a symbolic description), and the system being described (sometimes through a chain of description of descriptions, but ultimately a system, a four-dimensional piece defined by a boundary from the global space-time).

Thinking in the creation of new systems, in the learning/learning and subsequent modification of existing/brownfield systems, usually happens not for individual system instances but for system sets or types. Of course, you can imagine a situation where a specific system instance is described in a specific environment instance at a specific time (for instance, in a pump breakdown database record at a substation, an earthquake database record, a patient's medical history, or an event in a country’s chronicle), but these are usually execution time records, not development time. **Development (designing,** **planning)** **is always done not for specific system instances,** **"in general,"** **that is, for a set/type/kind/class** **of similar systems, even if it's about creating one system (say, the Eiffel Tower or a new country).**

A set/class/type/kind/sort is a mathematical/mental/conceptual object. In mathematics, a set of one object is not equivalent to that single object: the properties of a set differ from the properties of the object in that set.

In system thinking, it’s the same: we are interested in specific systems embodied in our physical world, but we model them using type/class assignment. Thinking captures something common in all situations; it happens not for specific systems about which we know different facts. Thinking happens mostly for **classes/types/sets/kinds** of systems/system_implementations/system_instances. And, of course, mental objects (sets, types) are easy to change: to modify abstract objects, no need to spend energy moving the substance of the system's embodiment; energy is only needed to change the substance for the representation of signs, a significantly smaller amount.

Information technology works with descriptions, so if you are dealing with computers and computer networks, be careful not to confuse a documented system description (an informational model on some physical medium) with the system’s embodiment. It's easy to understand that a person’s photograph is not the person depicted on it. It's a bit harder to realize that a paper sheet with rocket engine temperature data is a rocket engine description, and the paper itself isn’t important. But if it's about a small database describing the rocket engine's behavior in a series of tests, here's the catch: the database itself represents to its developer as some system, seeming to be the work's aim, the target system, the system's embodiment, a material/physical object, work's result. No, the database here is a documented rocket engine description, just in a less familiar form, documented not on paper. Even if you consider the engine control program along with this database and call it a **digital twin**^[<https://ailev.livejournal.com/1570630.html>], you would still be interested in the behavior of the **physical twin**, the rocket engine itself. When developing such a database and all programs around it, one must primarily think about the engine: the physical twin: the subsystem! If the developer doesn't keep the engine in mind, the database can easily diverge in its content from the real physical world's description and become useless or even harmful. The system here will consist of two subsystems: the digital twin::software (considering the hardware, software without a computer doesn't exist) as one subsystem and the physical twin as the other. If you don't understand which system you’re making and are only focused on the subsystem, you’ll face huge problems in the project: when the two subsystems start working together, the system won’t work—no money (and if it’s already paid, it might be reclaimed! Nothing works, what are we paying for?!).

**The skill of** **understanding which system is described** **in physical reality when shown a description in form of some documented data structures in a computer—** **this is a key skill for anyone dealing with modern information technologies.** If you have a CRM (customer relationship management^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management>]) system, then its databases describe the clientele as a whole system in the physical world, with parts of the clientele being individual clients (possibly grouped into segments, but that's not important now; what’s important is understanding the clientele as a system in the real/physical world, with the computer CRM system relative to this clientele being akin to a person’s photograph relative to the person, a document with descriptions and convenient document viewing tools).

This doesn't mean that at some point, we won’t be interested in the software system as a physical object. We will be, as a print book interests a printer. But we don't discuss the book's plot with the printer. Similarly, we don't discuss the "plot" with the data center administrator needed for the physical existence of the computer program. Be interested not in the program itself but in those system implementations described by the program’s data, whose changes in the physical world the program authors want to influence (in a CRM program, for instance, the authors aim to influence the clientele, not just the content of its database). If influencing the clientele through the CRM system doesn’t work, it may be unused in the project, not developed, or not made at all.

When you find the system described by the software, one can judge how well the program authors succeeded in realizing their intent—how effectively the software helps manage the described system in its data.

Thus, shopping software describes real physical products in a store’s stock, potentially coming to you, arriving in the physical world. The software affects these products.

If the software does not affect the state of the physical world, it raises questions. A computer program by itself isn't needed; it’s only needed to change the physical world through its descriptions. **Don't be deluded by the physicality happening in print shops, data centers, or couriers.** **Keep the focus on the physicality described by information carriers.**

Monitor your conversation partners' language: if someone says they are writing a report and their task is to "submit the report," verify: do they truly mean they described not the courier’s work of "delivering a package of papers"? Likely, it’s about “using the report results" for something changing the physical world. If this is missing from the conversation, your partner might be lying, deceiving, significantly mistaken, or poorly expressing their work's essence—and you need to ask additional questions to understand what’s going on with their work.

This requires having an extensive knowledge base and practical skills. If you make an ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, you need to understand: the ERP system documents and allows convenient viewing of various descriptions of resource flows (resources are raw materials, semi-finished products of varying processing stages and assembly, final products, “stuck” in an enterprise, that produces something—all are physical objects, occupying space-time). The ERP system exists as an informational model, a modern "pen-paper," external memory for company employees, just reflecting the resource flow state, and with the planning module, also reflecting the future state of the resource flow. This is fine; the world is four-dimensional, and future physicality suits us.

The sole purpose of an ERP system is accounting for enterprise resources to plan the maximum throughput of these resources through the enterprise. The more raw material (real physical, not raw material descriptions!) passes through the enterprise and comes out as finished goods (real physical!), the more the counter money flow (real money, think of it as heaps of gold) will be. Without **decisions for physically altering the resource flow** (ordering new raw material batches, loading certain equipment, utilizing specific warehouses, shipping under certain contracts), the ERP program with its databases wouldn't be necessary; the physical world wouldn't change.

Photograph/design/documented description and any other "information object" as "information carrier with information" always describe some system. The ERP program makes a "photograph" of the enterprise’s resource flow as a system embodiment. The system embodiment that interests us isn't the ERP system's embodiment as a "photograph" embodiment. It's most likely banal, like a book's embodiment—all are somewhat similar, a couple hundred glued pages with ink particles on them. The difference is in the books' content, and with the software—the software embodiments are similar; the difference is in the software content, what the software reflects in the physical world, what it describes! **The system's embodiment** **in the ERP software case—** **is likely not the** **ERP software itself, but the** **company's resource flow, a physical object.** **If an ERP software programmer thinks their task isn't modifying the enterprise's resource flow but the** **ERP software itself (and in the worst cases of this error—the** **ERP software source code),** **the project is in trouble. Verify if the software developers understand what their software changes in the surrounding world—** **and if they check if this “what” changes in the world, not just if they test their software! Yes, this applies to you too!**

If you know nothing about the physical object needing change through your descriptions, you will be unsuccessful; no systems thinking will help. At some subtle point, your work with descriptions will become entirely fantastical, disconnected from reality. The descriptions will not correspond to the past, present, or future world states. They will be fictional, utopian descriptions. In engineering projects, this is unacceptable; resources can't be wasted on implementing utopias and fairy tales!

**Systems thinking helps those who know their domain and whose knowledge extends to the physical world. Those who don't know their domain and don't mentally reach the physical world changes, nothing will help them. They will describe the bizarre, implement random changes in the physical world, or generally not affect the physical world with their fantasies.**

Of course, producing fantasies instead of engineering work doesn't mean they won’t be paid. Kittens change little in the physical world but are always fed and cared for. People (and even robots, even AI agents), if they don't bite, will also always be fed, regardless of their work results, even if the results are disconnected from reality and do not change anything in the world. But sometimes, such utopian works cause harm (if only wasting resources that could be used beneficially) even if these works are well paid. So avoid detachment from reality!

How are the concepts of "object in the real world" and "system embodiment" related? A "system" is a type for objects in the real/physical world. These objects are characterized by being distinguishable from the world (system boundary, a boundary in space-time—you can talk about the object's shape in the four-dimensional world). Everything outside the boundary is the system's environment/surroundings. System and system embodiment are synonyms. Of course, within a system, you can distinguish other systems; they are subsystems. Of course, you can distinguish a system with an inside system—it will be called a supersystem. We will gradually unpack the concept of "system," adding various connections with other concepts.

If we take a physical object, it usually has a type from the domain's subject area (a type from the meta-model/middle-ontology) derived from a domain textbook. For example, aircraft #45667 classifies as "aircraft" in the domain's subject area, logged as "aircraft #45667"::aircraft. The very concept of "aircraft #45667" will be a concept model corresponding to an instance of "aircraft" in the physical world (you don’t confuse the string "aircraft #45667"::aircraft” with the real physical aircraft? Strings can't fly!). We can record "aircraft" as a type and additionally in systems thinking record "aircraft::system," adding the "aircraft" type from the aviation domain meta-model as "system" from systems thinking as the meta-meta-model. The symbol **::** will show the type used in reasoning (apple::fruit), meaning **classification relation** (membership in a set). This was thoroughly covered in the "Rational Work" course, but in systems thinking, we add that "system" and other systems thinking concepts are the types you will most often assign. You'll see the world not as a set of mere objects but objects::system (objects of type "system").

We can record or even simply say "aircraft," without specifying the type—while clearly understanding that we just omitted the concept of the type "system" from the meta-meta-model. This is how systems thinking and life are connected, ensuring relevance to objects from project workflows: we mentally retain the types assigned to subject area objects (types defined by the meta-model from the subject area textbook) from courses of fundamental transdisciplinary thinking methodologies of the intellect stack (physics, semantics, concept theory, ontology, etc.)—everything needed for systems thinking, in this case, the concept of "system embodiment" as an assigned type. The objects with assigned types will be in the physical world, "in life."

Take China. In systems thinking, this will be "China::system," in a domain textbook (e.g., geopolitics) —"China::country." We can record "China::country::system embodiment" to show the full meta-modeling chain. But we can also simply write "China," understanding it as "country" and a "system" (keeping these types in mind! Not necessarily writing! But necessarily understanding the type mentioned "China"!). **It's crucial that you always** **"automatically"** **should keep in mind three mutually agreed objects:**

-   **object-from-life (sometimes it still needs to be found!),** **a space-time region in the physical world,** **("apple in life"). This is a model, a description of the real object.**
-   **object type from a discipline/theory** **of the method working in** **this subject area** **(“food,” or “counting object”—** **if apples are used instead of counting sticks, e.g., in a kindergarten),** **this is a meta-model, a domain model. This is taught in applied courses.**
-   **object type** **from** **fundamental** **transdisciplines** **(e.g., "system," "physical body")** **thinking methods of the intellect stack.** **This is a meta-meta-model, studied through education.**

And you end up with "life's apple," which can be either food or a counting object (food is eaten, counting objects in kindergarten are counted), but you can also assign the apple concepts of types "system" (discussing how to grow apples) and "physical body" (determining the apple's trajectory if thrown).

Working with types is a general principle for all thinking, not just systems thinking. You look at the world and already know a lot about it—this grants you the intellect, supplying you with types from the discipline of intellect-stack thinking methods. **These types focus attention on what's important, even if you are new to a situation. You can't say, "I have no clue what I see." If familiar with systems thinking, you might say, "I see systems"—** **and a lot follows from that. For instance, systems have a function—a purpose outside themselves. And you can immediately be interested in these objects’ functions you see, not wasting time figuring out what to inquire about these unfamiliar objects.**

Always first search for the system's embodiment; systems thinking is primarily about the physical world and its changes, even though it deals with descriptions. But descriptions are nothing, what they describe is everything. **All descriptions** **are made** **only to change what they describe in the physical world;** **there can be many, but** **on their own, they are useless, only needed in connection with ultimately describing some system in the physical world!**
