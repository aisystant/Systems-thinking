title: Alphas
---

Embodiment of the system, description of the system, creator --- these are all examples of
**alphas**, "apples from textbooks and workbooks", objects of the method from the set
of types of system approach, project thinking in system creation is conducted
using objects of these exact types. When you write, or
speak, or see "Boeing 737"--- as a systems thinker you
imagine some class of planes, which are systems “Boeing 727”::plane::“system embodiment”, and system embodiment is one of
the subjects of the development method. The system embodiment is material, it will
like an alpha in the course of the project go through states from "raw" to
"half-assembled" through "assembled" and "tested" to "in operation",
"upgraded", "decommissioned" (note that
"in operation" is given here in the present tense, while the other states --- through
the completion of some operations in the past tense). In speech, only
"Boeing 737" will appear, but in thinking and reasoning a systems thinker
would have this breakdown by types, it is important. An airplane "in raw" doesn’t
look like an airplane in the sky, but an alpha allows you to retain focus on
the airplane throughout its embodiment (again, notice: "system embodiment" in this paragraph is given in two types — as a physical object
of the airplane and as a process of manufacturing the airplane in "metal". Did you
notice that?).

**Work products/artifacts,** such as the documentation of various models
of the target system and super-system, systems of creation and their workings on paper or in
databases, project role performers, the material embodiment
of the system --- these are "apples that we eat," they can be easily found in
projects, pointed at (indicated their place in space). Say,
we want to track the state of the alpha "system description" for "Boeing 747".
How to do it? By the work products: the system description is contained in
various databases, and in these databases with the information model
of the airplane, you can find out, for example, whether some design decisions
have been made or not, whether we have a description detailed enough for
techno-economic project, preliminary project, working project. This is convenient: we consider the alpha
independently of which database the airplane description is reflected in, in what font this description is displayed on the screen, whether the diagrams in
this description or tables, or even just texts. But having reviewed the work
products, we conclude in what state the system description is,
how far it has progressed from "no description" through "description with main
architectural decisions ready" and "description sufficient for
manufacturing" to "description used in operation". All these
states are conditional, they will be further detailed through the states
of sub-alphas --- in each project their set of alphas is defined and adapted
to the project situation. More about alphas will be discussed in the course
"Methodology".

Many project alphas are usually well described in textbooks of the
project domain, related to metaU-model, and some of them are still
detailed in regulations or working standards of the enterprise,
related to metaS-model (and there in the regulations and working standards often
it is also said, by what work products it is necessary to track the state changes of these alphas).

But the most general alphas as the most general objects of the most general methods of work --- are objects of meta-meta-model, they are given to us in
knowledge/theories/explanations/algorithms of fundamental methods of thinking,
principally detached from the subject areas of specific projects.
That is why the disciplines of fundamental methods of thinking
intellect-stack (physics, mathematics, ontology, logic, rationality, etc.) are called trans-disciplines: they are "trans-",
beyond the scope of applied subject disciplines, they give us abstract types
of meta-meta-model, rather than more specific applied types of meta-model.

How to correlate objects of different levels of meta-modeling (different
ontological levels) --- this is the main difficulty not only in mastering systems
engineering, but also any other method of work,
describing the surrounding world and its regularities: how the objects of some
descriptions (for example, any theory/explanations, which are usually given at
a fairly high level of abstraction) to be combined with specific physical
objects or even objects of descriptions with a lower level of abstraction.

This is exactly what distinguishes physicists and engineers from mathematicians/pure
logicians: physicists are concerned with what their formulas correspond to in the real
world, while mathematicians/pure logicians are not concerned. Physicists are worried about
annotating the types of mathematics to the types of physical objects (making hypotheses
about such correspondences, conducting experiments with measurements and evaluating,
how the behavior of abstract objects differs from the measured behavior
of real physical objects), mathematicians mainly describe descriptions (though there are already
talks about experimental mathematics because you immediately fall into the physical world
and conduct experiments if the mathematical constructions require resources
of the mathematician itself as an agent, in their thinking modeling
mathematical/abstract objects).

If in the physical world there is an object "physical space," then this
means that in the world of mathematical objects there is an object "mathematical
space" and the physicist postulates that he will describe some
properties of reality, which he will call "physical space" (plus in physics there are
phase spaces and all sorts of other spaces), using the object of mathematical
space, which behaves in reasoning as
the physical space behaves in an experiment (in measurements in the real physical world).
This is all discussed by semantics, work with types, you need to figure it out once,
otherwise you will get confused when the physicist speaks about "space" from
the physical world, and when "space" from the mathematical world.

One of the MIPT students received two points for the exam on system
thinking because he couldn’t decide: "goods for shipment" are physical goods on the warehouse shelf,
or is this the list, which is displayed somewhere in the database of his computer?
Once in the conversation it was goods, and once --- the description of goods, which he called
goods since he mainly wrote the program with the description of goods, but
never saw the goods with his own eyes. And further these same goods
should still be called the target system --- and then it turned out that in the computer
these "supposed goods" (in fact --- the description of goods as tables in
the database) have a completely different environment, than real goods! Don’t be such a student!

**Work with types: descriptions come on many levels, but these are descriptions!
And the physical world --- ** **this is the physical world, and there levels are not abstractions
(in relation to classification), but system levels (in relation
to composition)!** **Distinguish the relationship of composition ("part-whole") for
physical objects and "classification" (class-instance) for descriptions!**

**When you work with alphas, reflecting the state of work products,
then you need to distinguish alphas from work products.** For instance, alpha
"engineering team" in life is represented by agents as team members,
and we learn about the team composition and decisions made about how
the team is organized from some descriptions (orders on team formation,
meeting minutes, instructions on role distribution in the team) --- they will bear witness to the team
going through various states.

**Alphas** (alphas) --- these are objects, by which we judge the
progress (progress, "how much have we already done?") and health
("is everything going well in the project?") of the project, by tracking the change of their states.

Alphas --- this is an abstraction of the same sort, of which "physical body"
is an abstraction of real physical objects. This physical body
has mass, while the geometric point has coordinates. But we
identify physical bodies and geometric points as
ideal/abstract objects with real/physical objects. We
"glue together" in thinking ideal and real objects, real objects
inherit characteristics of ideal objects --- we begin to think about real objects
as described in textbooks about abstract objects.
Therefore, both the weight and the atomic station have mass, and both
the feather and the airplane also have mass --- we can (**after rather long
training ** ** to align physical objects from life and
abstract objects from the textbook!**) understand that these are physical bodies and
transfer the characteristic of "mass" of this physical body to the weight, atomic station,
feather, and airplane. If you learned that the main alpha in the project will be the system’s work
(such a real engagement of the system, which changes something there in its environment, does
work/functioning), then we can track what happens with the work: "the system
hasn’t been worked yet", "work on test data was passed", "work is going on real data",
"work is interrupted", "work is finished" (and there is a cycle of states for "work is going on real
data" and "work is interrupted"). Why do you need the alpha work? To
track whether the system is just created, or created and already performing its
function. Whether the system is working or not is important, it needs to be
tracked. So you like a student have mastered the systems thinking (we are near
the end of the course!), you already have some mastery. Does your
mastery work? You are also a member of dozens of different teams --- are they working,
or just created and the work is halted?

It is customary to speak of instances of alphas in the project as if they are quite
real and exist in the world, despite all the abstractions --- these
alphas as mental objects we judge by artifacts/work products.

What is the concept of using an automated toothpick in our
specific ongoing project, right now, March 28, 2028? I can
judge what the external project roles need and how the toothpick fits
into its environment (that is, to judge the concept of use, this is a description, an abstract object, and also changing its state during
the project) by the available documentation of the concept of use. These might
be several different documents with parts of this model (parts of
the concept of use of some model of an automated toothpick),
but they may also contain a lot more that I don’t need right now.
The concept of use --- one of the alphas, the documentation of the concept
of use --- a set of artifacts/work products. What external project roles are
represented today by agents in the project, and which external
roles are represented by agents who already
cooperate with the team? I can look at the real
people-performers (or even not people, but robots), playing some role in
the project today --- and judge whether they are represented in
the project somehow, and are they cooperating (for example, they are tuned, if these are robots),
or the team still needs to work on this (or even discuss it,
whether the team considers the AI-robot as a team member, or just someone’s tool).

Alphas in their entirety give a "compact description
of the world"/theory/discipline/ontic/knowledge/model/algorithm/explanation,
convenient for describing progress in the project. Alphas are studied
by methodology; these are method objects primarily --- after all, the project is
simply a set of works on the method (that there are other variants of what
the term "project" denotes, we have already discussed this. But the classic
understanding --- is the set of works to create some system, that is
the set of works on all methods of creating some system, and
recently taking into account the third generation of systems thinking ---
the set of works to create and develop some system). Concepts
of methodology (method, object of the method, alpha as the most important object
of the method, which is needed to track changes in the project, works on
the method) serve to draw the project team's attention to the most important
in the project, changes which cannot be ignored, highlight this important
from the colorful background of many details irrelevant to this or that subject of
interest.

All this work with abstractions is needed to be able to reuse
known ways of reasoning and problem-solving for the most
different objects. So, we think about the "physical body" and "geometric
points" uniformly, "as in the textbooks of physics and geometry," and this
thinking applies to the most different "real objects around us," from a
matchbox to galaxies.

In this economy of thinking (we learn to think once, then likewise we think in
the most different situations) lies the meaning of separating alphas and
artifacts/products, only the talk is not about physics and mathematics, but about
the most different projects.

For example, we learn to think about the concept of use as a developed
model once, and then apply this thinking to determine the state
of development for specific paper or electronic documentation, which
can be found in production "in the real world" in the most different projects,
countless times:

-  requirements (if it is old engineering!), with a work product
  "requirements specification" (in modern development there is no such thing,
  they speak of different hypotheses about the required characteristics of the system and its
  behavior, while they try not to gather it all in one
  work product, it quickly becomes a "bottleneck" in
  development, so today they try not to store functional descriptions of the system in one
  work product)
-  use scenarios, and the work products here will be some 
  files with these scenarios written in their specific languages 
  (if they will be used) for some modelers,
-  descriptions from standard texts, and the files with these standard texts
  will be work products
-  user stories, work products --- cards with user stories,
-  wishes (not even needs, just "wants") of external
  project roles, and the work products can be, for instance, records
  of these "wants" in a database or files of questionnaires with
  these "wants",
-  ... and etc. There are thousands of artifacts
  that can document the concept of use and different descriptions in its
  composition, but to understand what it is and why the concept of use
  is needed when studying systems engineering requires only one time.

Remember, **systems thinking points to the concept of use** **as a necessary object of attention in the project**, **methodology teaches that the change of states of the concept of use must be tracked by alphas, and it will be
presented in the most different work products/artifacts,** but **methods** **of work** **for the development of the concept of use** (discipline/knowledge/theory, giving a set of alphas for identifying external project roles, their needs, identifying important events in use, identifying happy path scenarios and scenarios when difficulties are found in use, as well as the use of modelers for documenting the concept of use, etc.) **are taught by systems
engineering**.

Despite the "ideal" and "abstract" nature, alphas are spoken of as quite
existing in the physical world, much like physicists
consider the mathematical objects they use to model reality quite real
(take them seriously until proven otherwise by an experiment). So alpha
"concept of use" --- it is quite a real object, it has some state (first it's not there, then an initial is developed, then it will be realized by the created system, then it will continue to be continuously refined and realized by new and newer versions of the system), though in life these 
will be the most different files and database records on the most different
computers. Files here are nothing (form, although important for logistics in the
project, the information must be with those who need it, moreover, in the form 
that it can be conveniently used), the concept of use --- everything (content).
Alphas --- about the content, work products --- about the form. When thinking
about work methods, the alphas will be present primarily, and the work will be 
done with work products.

To judge the state of Prince Hamlet, we look at the facial expressions
and listen to the intonations of Vasya Pupkin, playing the role of Prince
Hamlet. And about the state of the concept of use (as the work progresses
on the development methods of the concept of use) we judge by the work
products-documents, in which it is described. More cunning situations are possible: about the 
state of the physical system (alpha "system embodiment", for instance, "embodiment of the payroll information system") at the
board meeting we judge by the work product "report about the state of the payroll system development", in which the state of
the system is described, instead of examining the system itself,
which may still exist as source code (of course, here we are not saying that "the
  embodiment of the information system exists first as raw material", but
  "the target servers for the information system are determined" here is quite a normal move for discussing the embodiment).

For instance, you can define the alpha of the functional object "my favorite
toy" --- and, although in my childhood it was a control panel of a spaceship
drawn on whatman paper, today it is my laptop, I can
talk about the state of "my favorite toy" levels of "loved",
"unloved", "broken", "in play", "abandoned" and etc., regardless of what my toy is now. Moreover, by observing 
the toy itself, we will not be able to tell its state --- the observation will need to
be done with me and my state! The work product for "my favorite toy",
by which it is possible to determine its state --- it is me!

If in thinking and conversation the "requirement" appears (those practicing
the old versions of systems engineering do this very often systems thinker
just smiles and understands, what is happening and how to mitigate the harmful
consequences of using such an alpha) --- then it doesn’t matter, the work product here
will be the point of the meeting minutes with the customer representatives, or
a record in the database of the requirements management system, or a fragment
of the diagram of some requirements model, or requirements from the customer's 
  email. In thinking it will be recognized as something,
related to the alpha of the system description, the sub-alpha
of the concept of use (at the same time, the systems thinker will replace 
the deontic modality of "should" on the doxastic "belief" --- "I require" will
be replaced by "I assume that it will be good, although I could be wrong") --- and
after that, it becomes clear what to do with it, how to think about the
content of this “requirement”. Of course, this alpha “requirement” will be
a description of the target system on the external boundary, which will need
to be aligned with the needs of external project roles. It’s immediately clear why it’s important to keep attention to
