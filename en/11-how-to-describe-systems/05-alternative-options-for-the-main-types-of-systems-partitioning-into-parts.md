title: Alternative Options for the Main Types of System Partitioning
---

Functional objects, structural elements, allocations, parts of the total cost of ownership --- this is not the only way to see parts in a system. There are countless ways.

Historically, different schools of thought have identified system parts very differently:

- ISO 15926 --- **two** main types of parts: functional objects, physical objects. Others can be introduced as needed.
- IEC 81346-1:2022 --- "at least" **five** (function, product and component as a custom product, location, type as an arbitrary grouping by certain properties, and "other" --- which can include anything, such as the creators' descriptions: administrative, logistical aspects related to the creators in the creation column, rather than aspects of the system itself). In our course, we mainly rely on this option, adding recently appeared cost as "other" and not particularly highlighting "grouping by type" --- it is indistinguishable from "other" (and the standard suggests making an agreement for "type" and "other" so the team understands what was chosen).
- Kosyakov, Svita, Seymour's book "Systems Engineering. Principles and Practice"^[<https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/28160736/>] --- **two** types: functional element, component (structural object).
- SMD methodology --- **five** (processes, elements and connections, external functions, morphology, material)^[<http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CLJYHzTDPj0J:www.mmk-documentum.ru/glossary/6>]
- ... and so on^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_model> --- here are examples of various options for enterprise architecture systems], on average 3-7 main types of parts, aspects of the system. However, "aspects" are also called differently everywhere: structural aspects, types/kinds of descriptions performed on a given type of parts as subjects of different methods in different systems thinking schools. And everywhere it is stated that this is "at least," that is, it is recognized that we are only talking about the main options that cannot be overlooked. And there can be many partitionings, they are made as needed, different in different projects. But the main partitionings are done in all projects.

In our course, we follow IEC 81346-1:2022, accepting that systems have three main aspects --- functional, structural, and allocation, adding a fourth aspect: cost, which is already a de facto main description in the digital twins approach^[<https://ailev.livejournal.com/1570630.html>], and continue with "and these four are the minimal number of aspects/variations of partitioning as the basis for various types of descriptions, based on different partitioning methods.

We also remember that the candidate for the next, fifth, main partitioning, which has not yet been included in engineering standards as "mandatory," but is increasingly encountered in real projects --- this is work breakdown structure from project management. It is needed to easily connect product partitioning and work partitioning and check: each job is done with a product, and there are no products without jobs and jobs without products. Difficulties with its introduction:

- Project management is very popular in engineering, but it is based on the old concept of the "life cycle" (a project implies a single passage through the system's life cycle, today this is replaced by creating an MVP and then continuous system development). Project management requires upfront planning, which is impossible for most projects. Details --- in the courses "Methodology" and "Systems Engineering".
- There is a huge confusion of work methods and the works themselves. Work methods in engineering have become the subject of situational engineering methods and standards for engineering methods were released, which were dedicated precisely to the "life cycle model". This development led to the work being cases, broken into sub-cases, but most importantly --- it does not require planning from the very beginning. This means that it is impossible to present a WBS (work breakdown structure) in a project at some point, unless it is a project of quite a narrow class --- it is most often about construction projects. And the understanding that the partitioning of methods is more fundamental (work planning is based on understanding the methods used) than work partitioning is not yet widely spread.

In the presentation "8D digital twin experience" by SNC-Lavalin at the June 2020 digital twins conference, 8 aspects^[<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjH1OPezfak>] were presented, D there stands for dimension, "measure" (another word for aspect, emphasizing the fact that the system exists as an object in many dimensions). Everything here is exactly the same as it was a decade ago in work on product lifecycle management (PLM), but today it's already about digital twins, not PLM, as the focus is not only on creating the system but also on its operation, and therefore, engineering data is supplemented with asset data, and the ultimate goal is autonomous operation (without a human, somewhere in an absolutely deserted area) based on a "single source of truth", the digital twin as a model of the system supporting agreed various descriptions of both the target system in its operational environment and the creating system. Note that so far this remains the "second generation systems approach," as multiple versions of the target system are not provided, meaning not just a single passage of the system's life cycle but continuous development of the system:

- 1D metadata, documentation (texts). We remember that in mechanical engineering, 1D-modeling refers to the physical modeling of a system's functional characteristics, but in the digital twins' world, the system's 1D aspect means something entirely different.
- 2D drawings (where "regular 2D electronic drawings" still exist, "native files" from CAD --- we remember that digital twins thrive on construction sites, and design methods and tools develop very slowly there, with 2D representations still found everywhere)
- 3D information models (this is a representation of the physical form/geometry/arrangement of the system indicating materials and many other characteristics)
- 4D "movie" of construction/assembly over time, adding a plan/schedule for construction or assembly to the 3D model
- 5D is resources, material status/cost, adding cost
- 6D is operation, real-time data (and we have moved from the enabling realm to the operation realm, and from this point, it is accepted to talk not about the PLM system, but the digital twin of the already created physical system)
- 7D is live streaming, transmitting a video stream of the working target system and its environment (from cameras, from satellites --- separate from real-time data from sensors, as it's huge volumes of data).
- 8D is analytics, predictive systems of machine learning (ML predictive data)

It is clearly visible that the basis here is not so much dynamic work method determination followed by planning but directly planning the work for creating the system --- it is assumed that this planning is possible. All this is mainly done for construction: "design once, build once, project/design modernization and building modernization are far outside the project's framework."

But the trend is obvious even in this narrow class of projects: there are always more than the four aspects we proposed (including arbitrary groupings by types and "other" if there were not enough types), and even these four partitioning options can be complex inside themselves, not "one aspect --- one description --- one document." And these aspects in pure form are usually not found, they are often tightly intertwined with each other ("hybrid"). Systems thinking recommends untangling hybrid descriptions, restoring the initial objects of interest/important characteristics, determining the objects of work methods of different project roles. And, of course, using multiple names for the same systems in these hybrid descriptions --- just to not confuse but untangle the hybrid descriptions.

Often, the hybrid appears because some product partitioning at the next system level is suddenly made functional, "jumping between times" --- partitioning in development-time is suddenly continued as partitioning in operations-time. This needs to be tracked, as "automatic jumping" can lead to errors, which we will consider later in the course.

Such "jumps" from type to type of system parts are many, leading to various types of errors: the placement partitioning (for example, breaking the house by floors) suddenly turns into product/structural partitioning (breaking by units of equipment on the floor). Or an engineering document suddenly transforms into a summarized-specification for procurement, and procurement prices come to the forefront. Is this possible? **You can do anything if you understand what you are doing. If you don't quite understand, then it's better not to do it --- and in any case, you must understand which aspect of the system you are discussing, what type the object-system under consideration is: functional? structural? placement? cost? other?**

For different roles in the project, the system will be presented in its different aspects partially, following the method of a particular partitioning option, but in systemic transdisciplinary thinking, it will remain holistic --- in terms of object types and relationships of these aspects (role and function, structure, embodiment, and composition, etc.). **System parts are highlighted in the physical system by attention, led by knowledge of transdisciplinary meta-meta-model types and domain-specific meta-models (we can also highlight metaU-models as in textbooks and metaC-models as in regulations). Different system partitions for one system --- this is simply the result of different criteria for highlighting parts with attention!** **And then based on the parts of the system held by attention, we construct various aspect and (even more often) hybrid descriptions of the system.**
