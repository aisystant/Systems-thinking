title: Systems description, description, description method
---

In a systems description, there are various aspect/role/specific descriptions (views) that answer questions about certain "areas of concern". A project role can have several areas of concern and multiple interests in each of these areas. These are all interests in the subjects of this role's work methods.

Each role/aspect description allows the system to be described in such a way as to support a conversation with the project role on the subject/topic/zone/area of its interests, answering its questions on achieving its preferences in the system's relevant characteristics. Many such descriptions are made, a significant number of them being hybrid (combining descriptions of certain areas of concern, showing several aspects of the system and the relationships between them, for example, the concept of the system as a role description of developers and architects showing coordinated descriptions of functional, structural, layout, and cost aspects).

What is the result of using multiple descriptions of the same system, even multilevel across different types of systems breakdowns (meaning a systems description—not "complete by types of descriptions," but "a description considering the multitude of system levels defined by different breakdown criteria")? The result will be a successful system: if the project role agrees with the description, then the implementation of the system meeting that description will likely satisfy that role as well (remembering engineering justifications: we will also substantiate during testing that the system's implementation behaves as described in its systems descriptions).

The success of a system can often be determined when the system implementation does not yet exist, but the system description does—even an incomplete description (errors in not accounting for certain interests may be visible even in partial descriptions). The use of 3D information models, drawings, simulation models in engineering, musical scores, and any other recordings in design and construction aims to thoroughly discuss the realization of the most diverse preferences in the important characteristics/concerns of different systems in the project before the target system is implemented. The discussion does not change if it is just the release of the next improved version of the system (not greenfield development "from scratch," system creation, but brownfield development of improvements, system development).

Project roles thus get access to descriptions, but descriptions themselves are immaterial, abstract. In reality, agents-in-roles view documentation/work products/artifacts: without an information carrier, there is no way to present descriptions for discussions. So **first and foremost all descriptions need to be documented, not kept in mind!**

There are many descriptions: different internal and external project roles are interested in extremely different **role/aspect descriptions/views** of the system. These descriptions/views reflect **important characteristics/concerns for various roles** of the system using various **role/aspect description methods/viewpoints** by which these descriptions/views are made. Of course, each description can be documented in different ways (for example, using different notations—numbers can be written in Arabic numerals, Roman numerals, in binary), on different media (paper, magnetic tape, computer memory, even the brain of a living person—a very low-capacity, poor, unreliable medium, but it's also an information medium! However, recording information in the brain is done in non-local/distributed representations, while recording information on computer media is now done in local/symbolic representations. Engineering now uses symbolic representations; they are resistant to error accumulation during multiple replications/copying).

All these numerous role/categorical/“by interest”/aspect descriptions (views) are sub-alphas of the systems (comprehensive/for all roles/for all areas of interest, for all system levels) description. There are, of course, many more of them than the usage concept, system concept, architecture; they are often cleverly structured (for example, the system concept in mechanical engineering develops into a technical-economic project, then a preliminary design, then a working design—which goes to production). These include financial models, physical simulation models, reliability forecasts, and numerous descriptions of what creation systems should do (for construction, this would be a POS, a construction organization plan—what builders should do during the erection of a building or structure, a combined description of the builders' work methods and the construction work itself): there are many descriptions, for some nuclear power plant in paper form twenty years ago it was several truckloads of paper, and that was not even all the documentation!

The difference between a description (alpha) and documentation (work products) is fundamental, but in practice, they are often confused. For instance, it's easy to confuse architecture (part of the system description) and architectural documentation (work products/artifacts/documents/files reflecting architectural decisions on some information medium). Often the word “documentation” is omitted and readers are warned that the context should make it clear whether talking about architecture (system description) or architectural documentation (a set of work products/artifacts/documents/database records with records of architectural decisions).

In literature (for example, ISO 42010:2022), the word “description” is often given not for an abstract object-alpha, but for documentation/artifacts, and in English, it will be a description. In systems engineering, our abstract “systems description” will be a system definition. In Russian, the word “definition” is confused with the dictionary meaning, so we translated it with a more suitable word by meaning, “описание”, and description was also translated with a more suitable Russian word “документация”. The confusion with descriptions is ubiquitous. Thus, ontology (or architecture or system color) can mean:

-   What exists in life (slicing the world into some objects, or the architecture of some system, or the color of some system—they are “in reality”)
-   Description (it is usually recognized as some aspect of various descriptions, then view if it is a project description “as it will be,” then definition). Often they say “ontology,” “architecture,” “color”—but they mean the ontological description (or synonymously—the description of ontology), architectural description (description of architecture), color description (description of color). And this is without touching the confusion of “description”::“object being described::method”. The method/process/activity of describing is often also called description! Here we mean the object of the method, not the method itself. The description method in English is viewpoint.
-   A document with a description, and also often they say ontology, architecture, color. But that's already the name of the document!

**You can easily figure out any terminology variant used in one or another description (pun intended), if you understand that there are always three different objects (described, description as ideal, and also material as description on the information medium)—they sometimes are designated by different words, accepted in different professional communities or different natural languages, but very often—by the same word.**

**Words are important (apart from words, we have nothing else), and not important (words usually mean not what you think—and you can't look up their meaning in the dictionary because there are many dictionaries, and the language is alive). Carefully trace the types of objects hidden behind suspicious terms (suspicious—the ones causing ontological jitter, that was in the course “Rational Work”), and everything will be fine.**

What terms might be suspicious? Not only the “description,” but almost all terms of system thinking, including the term “system”! Very often, “system” is used in a colloquial sense, simply to add “scientificness” or “engineering” to what is being said, sometimes as a synonym for “object” (“anything we are considering”)—and no system levels, emergence, creation graph, system development—nothing of the sort is implied by the one saying “system,” because not all those who say the word “system” are familiar with the modern systems approach. And “concept of use,” “architecture” can also be used not as sub-alphas for the alpha of systems description (as subjects of the engineering work method, to track changes in their states during the project of creating and developing a system), but in some completely different meanings (for example, meaning documents titled “concept of use” and “architecture”).

A complete systems description (description) in real life is quite rare, although always in projects there are attempts to somehow gather numerous documents with different role descriptions in one place. Much more common are just separate role descriptions of the system, documented in different documents (different information systems, different databases).

Only the genome will necessarily be in every cell of the organism, collected in one “document,” on one information medium. The genome^[[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Геном](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Геном)] itself—is an information carrier, a “set of hereditary material contained in the cell of an organism,” that is, a set of all chromosomes^[[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Хромосома](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Хромосома)], each of which in eukaryotes is formed by one very long DNA molecule. The genome is a document with a description of genetic information. More often than not, the genome means not a set of chromosomes/"DNA molecules" (document), but the genetic information documented by the genome! In engineering, it is about the memome (by analogy with the genome), which is stored somewhere in the design bureau and is the result of not biological (Darwinian), but techno-evolution. There is no agreement that the memome is material carriers (project documentation), so it can equally be project/design documentation, but it can also be project/design description. The idea of gathering all project documentation in one place is usually a failure. Even if all project documentation is considered to be in some design bureau, it will immediately turn out that there is production, which also has part of the documentation, part of the documentation is with contractors (such as suppliers of custom components), part of the documentation will be with tuners and operators (for example, some system settings that even designers will not know about). So the idea that the systems description (systems description) is reflected in some "super-document" is doomed to failure.

Given this, view is usually translated simply as “description,” without specifying that it is role/aspect/topic/subject/private, not (complete) systems. Every time you hear “description,” it will only answer questions about some subjects of interests/important characteristics; for answers to questions on other subjects of interests, other views prepared by other descriptions methods/viewpoints will be needed.

The concept of use is also a system description (although usage scenarios are considered extant, in the concept of use we have not the scenarios of use themselves, but descriptions of use scenarios, but the word “description” will be omitted), and architecture is a description (the same situation: architecture exists in the system, and architectural descriptions will contain descriptions of significant architectural decisions, in life, it will all be called just "architecture" and most often will mean descriptions), and reporting under RAS and IFRS are descriptions, but each of them is not a complete systems description.

Nevertheless, we are talking about the alpha systems description (system definition), since in the project the collection of all descriptions needs to be tracked in terms of their readiness. The alpha of the systems description can be advanced through its states by advancing the work of the project through the states of subalphas of individual private/aspect/role descriptions (views). There are quite a lot of these subalphas descriptions/views for the alpha of the systems description.

First of all, the most different roles in the project are interested in the states of progress through the course of the project for functional descriptions, constructive/modular/product descriptions, placement descriptions, and cost descriptions as parts of the system concept. This is the main thing; they will be conducted through the states “system concept ready,” “technical-economic project ready,” “preliminary project ready,” “working project ready” (remember that in different fields of activity these will be very different states, even in mechanical engineering, from which we borrowed this example). But then there can be a large number of descriptions interesting to various labor roles in the project: for example, synchronization in time of various contractors, the structure of ownership of parts of the environment, information flows, and more.

The more complex (more system levels, more subsystems at each level) the system, the more descriptions/views can be expected. **Important characteristics for people-in-roles of systems are diverse, and the success of the system is determined precisely by the completeness of their accounting (write it down!), and then the completeness of the agreement on the values of these characteristics. If you haven't taken into account and hence haven't agreed on descriptions affecting, for example, frost resistance::concern—you haven't received a successful system according to such descriptions. Or if you haven't taken into account and hence haven't agreed on various descriptions that show system behavior at different system levels—you also haven't received a successful system.**

Various objects dealt with in a project by different roles are:

-   From the point of view of the work methods of these roles—subjects of the method,
-   from the point of view of the motives driving agents to action, they are subjects of interest,
-   from the point of view of changing the state of these subjects, they are alphas,
-   from the point of view of thinking about these objects—are classified types of various models, meta-models, meta-meta-models, and even meta-meta-meta-models.

This is normal, but it immediately means that various objects will each be described multiple times using many different description methods. Systems thinking postulates:

-   The necessity of systems descriptions (system definition). They are important; they should be made and documented, even if you are lazy and do not have time.
-   The necessity of explicitly indicating for each of the descriptions/view as part of the systems description their methods of description (viewpoint). If you do not know what method you are describing something with, it does not mean that you are doing it without a method; therefore, think about the method and specify it.
-   The representation/presentation of descriptions in the physical world in the form of documents/files/artifacts. Do not keep descriptions in the chambers of your mind; make them in a readable form by other agents (people, machines)—and the first of these people (or machines, AI agents also take this course) will be you, and these descriptions will help your biological (or non-biological) brain be reliable in memory and focus.

The project documentation (systems description) should reflect the values of the important characteristics of systems in the project to technically keep attention on them during discussions/harmonizations of preferences in these characteristics of different project roles, using “external memory,” exocortex instead of "mentally, by willpower, good memory of people-agents." This is stated in all our courses, starting with “Rational Work”: humanity has gone as far from “thinking with bare brains” as from “working with bare hands,” without any tools.

How exactly to make these descriptions in various working projects is described in the corresponding methods of description of various applied engineering methods: classical “iron” systems engineering, software engineering, personal engineering, managerial engineering, social engineering, and so on.

For example, music is recorded in the form of a score^[[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Партитура](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Партитура)] in musical notation on paper sheets. How to make a score for a newly composed song? This is applied knowledge, and it will be extremely different in terms of notations for the score on paper and may take a completely different form if it’s about computer music. In systems thinking, you only need to remember that:

-   if there is a “song” (subject of the method),
-   then it must somehow be described using a description method. How exactly it is described (notation roll piano, or ancient Russian notation with hooks, or modern musical notation)—this is studied by applied methods of working with songs.
-   this description must be documented. Not documenting is not allowed (although there are differing opinions, there are improvisational genres, but in those it will be not a “song”^[<https://polit.ru/article/2007/10/05/martynov/>])!

If your project has both scores in musical notation, drawings, a schedule, and an organogram, systems thinking allows discussing all these separate descriptions, not losing them—leaving the applied disciplines the details of how exactly they are done and how to use them.

Systems thinking is the fundamental, permeating all applied methods of thinking tricks (“small methods/ways”) of thinking based on the concepts of the systems approach. **Knowledge of systems thinking cannot replace the knowledge of applied practices. Knowing that “descriptions are always at some level of abstraction of meta-modeling, but they may not be concretized and not documented”—is not enough. One must still know how to make these descriptions/view, that is, one must know the applied methods of classical and software engineering, management, medicine, law enforcement, political action, etc., and in these methods also know their included descriptions methods (viewpoints). Only mastery of systems thinking or even intelligence (as a fundamental mastery of thinking in new situations when it's not clear what to do) is not enough for work in projects for the creation and development of systems, you also need to have applied mastery in the method of project work that you need to use in your project role.**

The description method (viewpoint) reflects (frame) an important characteristic/subject of interest (concern), and the description (view) answers questions about the value of the target characteristic, satisfies interest in it. For example, the “legend of a fauna map”::description method reflects the “distribution of fauna in a specific area”::concern, and the map::description answers questions about the “presence or absence of fauna in specific locations”::“the value of the target characteristic/subject of interest.”

Nevertheless, subjects of interest/concern and “description method”/viewpoint, as well as description/view, are often confused (meaning “fauna distribution as a characteristic of some ecosystem/territory”::concern, “legend of the \[distribution\] fauna map”::viewpoint, and the “fauna map” itself::view). Of course, all these are close concepts, but they all draw attention to different objects, so for discussing nuances, they are all needed: it is necessary to locate objects of all mentioned types in the project: concerns, viewpoints, views.

If my role subject of interest/concern/important characteristic is the color of the system, and my preference/interest is a bright color, I will be dissatisfied if the color is not bright. I choose a description method for color (reflecting the important characteristic of interest using the description method), including the ability to describe the values of color saturation—this will allow me to predict the brightness of color in the system of my interest, test the obtained color brightness of the painted system, formulate preferences for color brightness, negotiate with other project roles regarding color saturation. Another project role is the engineer who has to paint the system. He might be concerned with ensuring the paint is cheap (satisfying the interest of another project role—the financial manager), and the brightness of this paint may not concern him. But cheap paint is not bright. If I document the color I need, described using standard characteristics of colorfulness, chroma, saturation, plus take into account external lighting (brightness), then at least we can negotiate about acceptable color characteristics, and as a result, the engineer can choose a cheap but bright enough paint to my role taste (role taste! As an agent, I might prefer subdued colors, but in the project role, I make a professional judgment on brightness: I realize not my personal preference but a role preference)—my role preference for "bright color"::“value of important characteristic”
