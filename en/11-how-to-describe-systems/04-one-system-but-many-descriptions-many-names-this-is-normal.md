title: 'One system, but many descriptions, many names: this is normal!'
---

Quaternary (these are only the main four! There are many, many more!),
multiple aspects of perceiving an integrated system are normal,
as it should be! One time you consider the system as consisting of
functional parts with their behavior during use, another time
you see the system as constructive with the behavior of
fabrications during their production and assembly, a third time
you view the system as consisting of layout spaces, then
you check the total cost of ownership, the working methods,
the works themselves, and how much time they'll take from whom, and so on—while trying to hold all these notions simultaneously so they align with one another.

**Unified** **in** **the mind** **for different** **project roles with
different interests,** **can only be a unified thought**, thus there will be no unity
in the partitioning, no unity in the system viewpoint within the project.

Real unity of all these descriptions is given only by 4D extensionalism:
“constructive parts”/constructives/products/items/modules/affordances
(what it’s made of) occupy the same space-time locations as
“functional parts”/roles embodied by the constructives.
This “occupied space” itself—that's “placement”, and the system
costs something as well (ideally less than the external roles, like a customer, assess the irreparable benefits it brings).

The relationship between a role and a construct is
realization/realization/embodiment. In practice, this relationship is often expressed
as “playing a role”, i.e., performing a method/function as the role’s behavior.
**Both constructive descriptions and functional descriptions** **are descriptions**
**of the same** **system as the same** **physical object in space-time.** **No identification**
**of constructive and functional descriptions** **through reference to types, through**
**“definitions”,** **as in logic or mathematics! All identifications** **only** **through to
physical reality, to** **the physical object in a specific space-time**
**location!**

The four main ways of highlighting parts of the same system provide
four main ways of organizing attention, highlighting the essential and
discarding the inessential, and these are just the main ways—there are usually more! Subsequently, **project roles must agree that all** **four** **main** **descriptions, as well as others (not categorized as main but necessary for work),** **do not contradict each other and describe the same system.**

German electrical engineers, authors of the IEC 81346 standard for system
descriptions, devised a method: to immediately see what type of system part is being discussed, they are named using special prefixes:

- functional/role prefix "=",
- modular/product prefix "-",
- placement prefix "+".

The names of objects from a specific partition under one relationship
are given at each level of the partition’s hierarchy (remember: partitioning
is a hierarchy with part-whole relationships). But in each partition,
the “part-whole” relationship is constructed according to one specific type of objects in the partition.

For example, =S12=16 indicates a functional part 16,
part of (relation composition/is\_part\_of) functional part S12. The number of
levels in the partitioning hierarchy in the name is unlimited.
Functional/role name engineers often call **tag** (tag).
Designing, of course, takes place in types/classes: this is the name of the types/classes of the system parts, not the specific parts of a specific
implemented/realized physical system at a particular moment in time
(instances of material embodiment of objects of that type/class that were in the project/design).

If the name is -M87-K5, it refers to the product/module/construct/item
K5, which is part of the higher construct M87. This too is not a specific
physical object with a serial number, but a type/class of these objects,
a type of products of a certain brand.

The standard IEC 81346 formalized such naming to provide short **codes**
instead of “normal” long names. Indeed, if there are 6 million individual parts
(part—a construct that isn’t assembled from its subconstructs)
in a Boeing 787, it immediately means they’ll have several names, plus
functional names, and place names. In this case, it’s better to keep these
names short, and for each name to make clear to which type of parts from which partition
and whole these parts belong to within the aircraft.

The standard IEC 81346-1:2022 formalizes the modern engineering consensus
about the three main types of system partitioning into parts. In total, it introduces
five partitions, besides functional, product, and placement, there are
also “type” for arbitrary grouping by some attribute and “other” for everything else—logistics, cost division, administrative subordination. Our cost partitioning under this standard will fall into this “other” partitioning, other aspects.

If you look at today's engineering projects, naming::method
(slight differences between naming/naming::method,
identification/identification::method, and
designation/designation::method with slightly different
subjects of all these methods we will not consider here) of system
parts and the whole system is exactly like this, adding other characteristics to such names
and codes, such as voltage or pressure, standard size, and even price
(although price is no full substitute for total cost of ownership, and
it is not a name or a code, without this description talking about the system
is no longer customary).

We have already encountered situations where Prince Hamlet and Vasily Pupkin
could be the same human agent but called differently depending on what we need from him: to understand what his next line will be in his play (this is about the role/functional, i.e., about Prince Hamlet), when he plans to learn a new role in a new play
(this is about the construct, i.e., Vasily Pupkin), or to find out if he has children (this is about the construct, i.e., Vasily Pupkin, unless talking about “the children in the play”). The same can be said of inanimate systems, for example, differently named systems may turn out to be the same device:

- “pressure gauge in the fifth cooling loop”::“role/functional object”,
- “KLM-23 pressure gauge from 'Automation Assembly Plant'”::“construct
    object”/product/module,
- sensor in “fifth box on the third shelf of warehouse number 4”::placement,
- “$300”::cost.

In reality, you are unlikely to see around such names an indication of the type of object from the meta-meta-model, but here we indicated the types to explain the difference in the types of objects designated by such names, in real life, you will have to understand each time what type of object is named by one or another name.

Different names indicating very different types of objects signal that we will
employ very different methods for working with this subject of the method, thus, the same device appears in different guises, making it convenient to call it different names
for different methods of work. This is normal; it’s unavoidable in projects!

**Forcing all the roles in a project to use the same name** **(including the same classifier which helps to give a unique code), the same** **partitioning of the system into parts—** **is impossible, unproductive,** **this** **is an error. Acknowledging role-based thinking driven by role-based interest** **in the method’s subjects requires many names for objects, many classifiers for system parts.**

But names should be given meaningfully, not just as a free-for-all where everyone writes as they breathe because “I am an artist, I see it this way”. These are all culturally
conditioned names, “cultural” here reads as culture from the long synonymous series:
method/style/culture/practice of work. Type of labor, engineering, occupations, as well as strategy and even service—this too refers to methods, knowledge/theories/explanations/algorithms of these methods and the tools of these methods. Choosing “culture” from this synonymous series means only that the method is shared by a fairly large number of people, it is widely recognized. So names should not be invented arbitrarily, but given based on
civilization’s accumulated knowledge about similar subjects of methods. But since many methods can be applied to a single system as the subject methods, the system will have many types and corresponding names.

“Prince Hamlet—Vasily Pupkin” is quite cultural (i.e., understandable to many people without additional explanations), even though it uses two names of separate guises of the actor: the character and the performer. Similarly, system names in industry can often consist of names of several guises, e.g., “=S12=16 --M87-K5 $300” (composite name of one system consisting of three individual names of this system). Such names satisfy the interests of different project roles, individual names are listed through spaces. We notionally count price as a name, though it isn’t exactly so, but noting the financial characteristic near a name does not feel unusual; this is what we want to emphasize.

Such a composite **“system** **name”/“system** **designator”** can usually be used in one specific project just as the composite name “Prince Hamlet—Vasily Pupkin” can only be used in one play; in another play, role distribution will be different. All these composite names talk about a particular place in space, so it’s always possible to figure out which system is named by such a composite name by specifying the situation in the physical world. It is pointless to investigate by requiring definitions for all the constituent names, then aligning different objects in the project to fit the definition! No, you need to immediately specify/ground, moving from types/classes and definitions to objects in the physical world (or at least examples of objects in the physical world).

**You are warned:** **arguments about definitions** **(often called**
**“argument about terms”)** **are meaningless,** **and** **systems
thinking—** **is not mathematics, not defined by “strict definitions” and
“unambiguous names”!** It is useless to clarify definitions “as in mathematics”, “as in the dictionary”, “as in science” and demand identical names for

- the hot system (functional name),
- the system bought yesterday (product/construct name),
- the remote system (spatial name),
- the expensive or cheap (cost name) system.

The situation should always be clarified, but not through definitions, only through
understanding where these systems are located in physical
space-time: if in different locations-times, they are different
objects, if in the same location-time, it's the same object described differently—the same system. Having many descriptions, not one, many names, not one, is the norm in systems thinking, and systems thinking also offers 4D extension and grounding as methods to combat confusion in the multiplicity of names for one system.

The essence of the systems approach is not to forget the system as a whole—system's realization/ realization, which only differently appears by different project roles as divided into parts of a certain type, depending on the methods by which these project roles will act.

Becoming fluent in such simultaneous retention in attention of different
representations of different roles to satisfy their different interests in
the same object, becoming fluent working with many descriptions of one
system, including many variants of system partitioning into parts,
requires some time to learn, although the idea of multiplicity of names for multiplicity of types (classification in multiple classifiers, convenient for different work methods for different roles) is usually understood at the first presentation. But it’s one thing to understand, quite another to freely master such thinking oneself, retaining attention on the same objects as subjects of different work methods and therefore having different names.

It is helpful here to write down these objects of attention: no one demands
holding this systemic multiplicity in mind, write them down! In systems thinking usually “all moves are recorded”, greatly easing life. A computer is not forgetful, records in it are accessible to many agents (not only people!), carrying out the most varied work methods with the most varied subjects of these methods, the most various roles in the project, so **system partitions are always documented, it is not customary to agree on system partitions** **“by word”.** **Write your partitions!**
