title: The Struggle with Complexity in Thinking

Edsger Dijkstra in 1974
introduced^[<http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html>]
the concept of **separation of concerns** as
a way to organize human thoughts about a subject. This principle states that one should discuss complex situations one important characteristic (concern) at a time, focusing the attention of various roles on a single aspect or side of the situation. This does not mean ignoring all others, but rather keeping both the single aspect being discussed right now and the overall situation in mind. According to Dijkstra, this kind of thinking is "It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously".

This division of thinking by subjects of interest is conducted recursively, in the understanding of Systems thinking — it’s the same thinking methods at each of the numerous systemic levels. Each system at each systemic level has many concerns, and they are discussed one by one. Due to emergence at each systemic level, systems, subsystems, and supersystems exhibit different sets of properties and characteristics, requiring discussion of different systems and their different characteristics. There are many concerns for each system at each systemic level, plus there are concerns regarding the creators, which is a creation relationship — but this too is a systemic approach, starting from its second generation.

The complexity of describing/discussing a system is thereby reduced by splitting a single entangled super-complex discussion into several less entangled and complex discussions in two ways:

-   dividing the complete discussion of the whole system into **discussion of its individual parts by systemic levels.** Each part of the system is simpler than the whole system, therefore the discussion proceeds more or less uniformly at each level, and each part of the system is described **by the concept of its use** (ConOps or OpsCon, accounting for the nuances of their similarities and differences, varying by engineering school of thought), i.e., by describing the system as a “black box.” In it, the internal structure of the system and its parts is ignored, so the discussion always starts with whole systems within the supersystem, or whole subsystems within the system, and so “all the way down” and “all the way up.” Systems thinking as such stands “aside,” it is transdisciplinary, keeping everything in systemic division in mind to ensure nothing is forgotten. The systems of each individual systemic level in their breakdown can then be discussed by practitioners of one team or even different teams.
-   dividing the complete discussion of each system at one systemic level into **discussion using multiple descriptions of different aspects** of that system as a transparent box. The most important of these descriptions – **the system concept** (systems concept), includes functional, constructive, spatial, cost descriptions, and many others. This division is based on the main engineering roles (visionary, developer, architect, platform engineer), also specializing in specific types of systems on a given systemic level.
-   Separately, **discuss the creators in the creation graph**, which means following the creation relationship rather than the part-whole relationship. Systems thinking forces you to keep the creators in mind!

**Detailed and thorough discussion of large complex systems and their creation graphs** **principally (due to the very essence of the Systems approach) can be broken into sufficiently small parts, ensuring no part of the discussion is overlooked, and no description is missed. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time!**

Systems thinking by nature is collective, allowing for the separation of both mental (by design) and physical (by manufacture and operation) labor, engaging many different living and non-living performers in diverse project roles — while carefully considering the parts of the system at all systemic levels to account for all known role interests at each systemic level.

But how to agree on how to combine all these different descriptions of different parts of the system into one comprehensive system description? How to get all these roles and their performers to agree? All these descriptions can be combined if one understands that they all describe the same point in space-time, relate to the same embodiment of the system. At the center of any Systems discussions will be the physical embodiment of the system considered at runtime, linking to all other considerations.

Without a systemic approach, it’s impossible to complete complex projects involving many different specialists on time and successfully: the system will fail because someone’s interests won’t be accounted for (i.e., forgotten, lost: the team’s attention won’t suffice!), introducing an error in the system, leaving people dissatisfied with its operation or with the project creating the system. Plainly: if you forget to discuss one system, subsystem, or supersystem “of our” system, or the target system, or even the creator - there will be trouble, “if something can go wrong, it will go wrong.” Collisions are inevitable, something will have to be reworked, consuming unplanned resources.

**Systems are discussed one part at a time, one description of a part at a time — never losing sight of the whole system in its environment, and also its creators.**

Creators ("systems of creation", omitting the word for the type of
meta-meta-model) — are also systems, but it’s important not to forget that their entire existence is related to the target system and hence should not be referred to as the targets themselves. But they can be "our system" for managers as enterprise engineers. If a manager suddenly says, "my enterprise — that’s my target system," it violates the collective nature of thinking; the manager will be unable to agree with anyone. They should honestly say that the target system is what their enterprise produces (even if the enterprise provides a service), while the enterprise itself is “their system” (not a common system for all).

If you provide a product for use within an enterprise or organizational link (or part of it, if not the entire enterprise or link), it becomes the supersystem for your product. A clock you deliver to an auto plant can be used by plant workers (not just "clock users") either in the car produced by the plant (similarly, plant workers are not just "clock users") or in the workshop (where they first act as workshop developers, a supersystem for the clock, and then as time-interested, "clock users").

In enterprise engineering, all systemic considerations remain the same, but terminology and practices change. For example, enterprise modules are called **departments** (less often referred to as **org links**, but systems thinking considers collegiate bodies such as working groups, councils, and commissions), functional parts of the enterprise are its **org roles**, the functions/methods of work for org roles are often called **work processes**, and configuration management of the enterprise is called **accounting**. Importantly, org links are not **developed** but **organized**, and manufacturing itself is not **production** but **leadership** (explaining to rational individuals how their org link is structured and their place within it, cooperating with others — this is leadership). More details are in the “Systems Management” course.

When it comes to organizational systems, the concept **enterprise engineering** became relevant a couple of decades ago, but the terminology didn’t become “iron-engineering” nor universal across systems, i.e., meta-meta-model level. In other types of systems (medicine, law enforcement, dance, politics, etc.), terminology might differ even more from that of engineering and Systems thinking. In education (personality engineering) it's about mastery engineering, highlighting roles:
visionary — cultural promoter, designer — methodologist, technology engineer — methodologist, etc. (for more, see the “Personality Engineering” course).

**Words don’t matter**, what’s important is the general structure of thinking (what to pay attention to in all these projects: Systems thinking manages attention). **Words matter**: without the terminology of a specific domain, you won’t understand the subject matter. Also, types of meta-meta-models are important: with them, you’ll see the commonality in diverse situations, projects, systems, and types.

-   **In each project, you will need to correlate** **"apples from the text** **book"** **with** **"apples from real life": identifying concepts corresponding to objects from various domains** **(domains, concepts from the meta-model)** **with** **fundamental concepts of Systems thinking** **(meta-meta-model).** **Remember, it's just about navigating: you’ll quickly understand your location. Next, you’ll need to:**
-   **Strategize, figuring out which method with which method objects you will work** **— even if neither** **you nor anyone else** **knows exactly what needs to be done for success. Propose several methods most likely to succeed for the entire endeavor, then use decision-making methods to select the one that can’t be criticized.**
-   **Plan your actions based on the chosen method, tying them to specific time and resources.**
-   **Take the plans seriously: allocate (or even obtain, if initially unavailable) resources and execute these plans, even if it’s about step-by-step planning.**
-   **And continue thinking systematically, examining what Systems thinking points to as important, holding this crucial information in collective attention among project participants, preventing attention from scattering.**
