title: Systems Modeling as the Creation of a Multi-Model. Mega-Model.
---

Modeling in systems thinking is the main tool for dealing with complexity in projects. High complexity is when there are too many details in descriptions, so the brain (and the computers aiding it) needs to perform many calculations. The number of calculations can be significantly reduced by eliminating calculations over the unimportant.

At a glance, it is usually unclear what is important to describe and what is not. Here everything is simple: important objects (instances) of the domain are defined by the domain description method (domain meta-model, domain ontology), and important objects for working with domain description methods are defined by the meta-meta-model, the general transdisciplinary/fundamental ontology of thinking methods (often called upper ontology, our course reveals part of the concepts of this ontology).

**Modeling —** **is the description of only the most important, and leaving out the unimportant in the description.** **Want to fight complexity —** **think in terms of modeling!**

**Documenting models allows not only to describe the important but also to keep it in focus for as long as needed for reasoning. And the unimportant is not kept in focus, remaining only in conversations** **during modeling when you discuss the modeling method and make guesses about what should be included in the model.**

Concentration and modeling go hand in hand, we do not trust the biological brain in modeling; we record all modeling results! Thinking in terms of modeling is not a "mental act"; it is simply the explicit use of some description method during written thinking. **If you do not write —** **you do not model, you do not think!**

**For modeling at each level of abstraction, you need to know three types of objects:**

-   **Modeled object** from a real-life situation (somehow related objects in a domain). Ultimately, these are some objects of the physical world, something important and something not important about which is known to someone. There may be some modeling graph, and then it is about some models of other models (modeling models is also quite possible! One model then allows making judgments about the behavior of some other model in some critical respects. For example, you can create a table describing cities and their population, and take the information from some geographical map where this information is available — if you do not need the relative locations of the cities but only need the population information). There is a lot of information, many objects of attention, the task of modeling is to cope with the compactification of thinking: the agent’s calculator (brains and computers, or even a work collective), which operates in the domain, gets overloaded with processing unimportant information. Such subtleties as the differences between reality and actuality are not taken into account here. Reality is everything that exists, and actuality is everything we know about what exists in reality and can somehow describe, so we perceive not the whole of reality but only actuality. Dealing with the domain (the objects themselves, not their descriptions!) is the subject of ontology, the answer to the question "what objects are there in the world” (how the physical world, as well as the mental/abstract world is divided into objects, and why these and not others). For example, you model some fruits: you write that there is apple-1 on the table, apple-2, and the only banana, which we will number to emphasize its "instance-ness”, banana-1. And ignore plates, napkins, and everything else. These physical two apples and the banana are the subject of modeling.
-   Types of objects to look for in the world. They are defined by the description method, which contains the meta-model. This **meta-model** defines the types of objects that are important in the domain. If we describe the table, identifying fruits on it, this is the assignment of the type "fruit” and the kinds of fruits (specializations of fruit) "apples" and "bananas". There is also a meta-meta-model with types, allowing to find objects of the meta-model itself. Thus, banana::fruit::"physical object". The meta-meta-model allows reasoning about meta-models: comparing them, integrating, complementing, clarifying, checking reasoning against them, and generally discussing which meta-model is currently needed to describe the modeled object.
-   The **model** itself (sometimes called the "operation model" or "instance model" for clarity). In the case of a physical model, these are some items retaining the main characteristics defined by the meta-model, and in the case of an information model — these are some description objects whose types are defined by the meta-model. The important thing is that the model here appears in the discussion only after defining the meta-model. In other words: the description appears only after we have defined the piece of reality we want to model, then set the types of objects we want to find in reality — and only then create and document the model. In our example, we write strings of symbols “apple-1” and “apple-2” and also “banana-1” — but these are already objects in the world of descriptions. More precisely, of course, it would be to write “apple-1”::apple::fruit, “apple-2”::apple::fruit, banana-1::banana::fruit.

This trio of objects exists at each modeling level. The thought process from modeled instances in the world to the model, then the meta-model, then the meta-meta-model, and so on, is called "meta-modeling”. And the process in the opposite direction is modeling. So, when modeling meta-model objects, you will have:

-   Modeled objects — meta-model types.
-   Types of objects to be found in the domain of the meta-model — meta-meta-model.
-   Model — the meta-model.

This principle of meta-modeling (from the world to increasingly higher abstraction levels in types) and modeling (from highest abstractions to lower) must be memorized since the number of meta-modeling levels (number of hierarchy levels relative to classification) can be very different. But as in any hierarchy, always remember: there is a level above and a level below, the type of relationship must be retained throughout the hierarchy, and be extremely careful with reasoning at extreme levels. For example, the "extreme level" may not even be extreme for upper ontology, higher levels will include objects of different theory concepts. And at the bottom of the hierarchy, there may be a transition not by classification relationships, but by the representation relationship between the model and the modeled object.

How to identify this trio "modeled object, model, meta-model" in life? Very easily: in descriptions, pay attention to headings and their types in some human-readable formats, and in machine-readable formats — to data models. Usually:

-   Modeled object — it exists somewhere in the world, absent in the description. For example, an Excel document describing the technical and economic project/design of a sepulka of 8 Watts: the sepulka itself will be in the world, and only its description will be in the technical and economic project.
-   The titled — refers to the model. For example, it will specify that this document is a technical and economic project of the sepulka, with the sepulka power of 8 Watts.
-   But "technical and economic project" as well as "power" (and unit of power) — will be elements of the meta-model. Many models with these types can be made. Roughly speaking, "document form, just headings with unfilled fields/requisites" (sometimes called a template, a blank form, or a "blank”) — is the meta-model, these headings are the types of the meta-model.

Where to look for the meta-meta-model (types of objects from foundational thinking methods we study in our courses)? Very rarely these types are explicitly included in descriptions, but more often than not — no, they are "inferred mentally", primarily by the creators of forms/templates/blanks. So "technical and economic project"::description and the fact that it is not about the sepulka itself but its description "technical and economic project" — is mentally maintained, somehow determined "from context". That "important characteristic"/"concern" for the sepulka user — power in Watts ("power in Watts"::concern), is also "inferred". In some databases, the meta-meta-model must be explicitly specified. But in most cases, it is not mentioned.

Systems thinking (and other thinking methods in the intelligence stack) forces attention not only on three levels (object in life, model as value in form, meta-model as value heading, for instance, heading of a requisite in a form or column in a table or even the document's heading, but also add a fourth, "in mind" — type of meta-meta-model from thinking methods. From this moment, you know what mental operations can be performed with these objects.

Remember: if A::number, then multiplying the number by the number is possible, but breaking with a hammer — no. If A::nut, breaking with a hammer is possible, but multiplying a nut by a nut — no! Types protect from errors and allow agreeing on the important. Thus, the meta-meta-model tells us the really important things, even more important than the headings (meta-models) in description forms/templates!

How to determine what is important? Important in descriptions is only that which helps to work by some methods (including description methods, but only "among others"). If you cut::the method forest::"subject of the method", then descriptions of forest beauty, shades of green in tree leaves, the number of ants per hectare of forest are unnecessary, they don't need modeling. But the thickness of trees, the number of trees per hectare to be cut, clearings for removing cut trees, and so on, need modeling.

For different project roles, the system's important characteristics are different, and different project roles want to move their values in different directions and need to know the values of many other characteristics for this (since in systems everything is connected, parts of the system interact, so all characteristics' values are interlinked, all roles understand this). What is important for a role in performing its method is defined by the domain meta-model of that method from theories/knowledge/disciplines/explanations/algorithms of the method. The domain is the subjects of some method, important are not the subjects themselves, but the states of these subjects and possible operations with them that translate these subjects from one state to another.

The meta-model at each level always exists (thus, the meta-model for the applied domain is a set of types of foundational thinking methods). To avoid confusion, we look at the hierarchy of meta-models in the classification relationship and simply add "meta-" for each relationship to maintain not just the relative naming of levels (modeled object, model, meta-model at each abstraction/classification level), but the absolute naming (modeled object, model, meta-model, meta-meta-model, meta-meta-meta-model, but this may be organized as modeled object, model, metaU-model, metaS-model, meta-meta-model, etc., or some other way). Remember that the number of meta-model levels may vary significantly from project to project, as different modeling agreements suitable in the context of a particular project may be adopted. Hence, the principle of reasoning in this paragraph should be understood rather than simply copied into your project. Meta-models (and even meta-meta-models) can be numerous, and levels of "meta-" can also be numerous.

Part of the meta-models in the meta-modeling hierarchy is determined by the human brain's or the computer's apparatus perceiving the world. Firstly, it concerns the apparatus for foundational ontology as the theory of concepts^[<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/>], defining high meta-modeling levels, what concepts can generally exist in models of all abstraction levels. But the modeled objects can also depend on apparatus. For example, if we have no way to measure voltage and current, we cannot model them well (the concepts of volts and amperes appeared relatively recently in physics).

The importance of an object in the world worthy of its concept is determined not in one step of modeling but in many steps: even that objects and relationships exist in the world turns out to be a result of modeling — meta-meta-meta-model, or foundational ontology. It is necessary to be extremely careful about the number of modeling levels and whether we have reached the last level or stopped somewhere (usually, if reached — this is called "ontology", and if stopped quite low at the meta-model of some domain and were not too concerned with the types of the meta-meta-model — this is called "ontic", such a "half-baked ontology", as it ignores the full hierarchy of meta-levels and their consistency). Here, as always, ontology as the study of different ontologies and ontics and specific ontologies or ontics is designated by the same word (like geometry and, for example, Riemannian geometry or logic and Tarski's logic).

Of course, there are many schools in ontology as a doctrine of existent objects in the world (more precisely, types of objects), which use different terminology. Thus, "meta-meta-model" from our course, following the engineering tradition of meta-modeling, in specialized literature is called upper ontology (objects described in fundamental theories/knowledge of thinking methods in the intelligence stack, transdisciplines, for instance, the concept of "system" is precisely from there), and the meta-model is called middle ontology or applied ontology (this is modeling of the domain of some applied work method, for instance, mechanical engineering as a method of creating "machines" — transport, machines, and other equipment utilizing mechanical forces). Instance model/operational model is simply a "model" of some instances of objects, not object types. But also "model" is used for any meta-model, easily leading to confusion. Nevertheless, three-four levels of "meta-", i.e., levels of type-setting for types (abstraction levels, levels of concepts in classification hierarchy) are usually sufficient.

All this was discussed in detail in the course "Rational Work”. We will repeat this reasoning several times as it is important: you focus your attention not on arbitrary objects in the world and other models that "catch the eye” (they might be important or not. Unimportant objects may distract much attention from the important ones!). You pay attention to important objects (even specifically look for them, and if it is about designing, then specifically propose them), but the very fact of the importance of these objects' existence is set by the meta-model you have at that moment. And if you do not have a meta-model, you look for its objects exactly like this: paying attention to those objects set by the meta-meta-model, for this reasoning works at any ontological level. If you look for something important in the meta-meta-model, you have in mind a meta-meta-meta-model (theory of concepts) at that moment, which serves as a meta-model for the meta-meta-model. If you do not know the theories of concepts (say, theory-theory — that we represent the world mainly in objects and their relations, not in prototypes) — you will not understand the meta-meta-model (material of our course). Do not know the meta-meta-model — will muddle through ontics of domains.

Importance is set multi-level, we do not grab random objects with our attention. Education (learning meta-modeling in particular) is needed to know what important objects we are looking for in the world or (in case of inventing something new) in our imagination. Education is needed to save time on unimportant calculations! **Education is also needed to understand why it is needed (as strangely as it sounds).** For instance, education is needed to understand: without knowing ontology (how to meta-model at many levels), there will be no systems thinking, as you will not be able to construct system descriptions consciously. Literally, the next paragraph contains a description of a real situation: “A financier wants to prevent a cash gap." We will annotate it with types from our course.

Financier::role wants to prevent::preference/interest “cash gap”::subject of interest. From this course section, we know that it is necessary to make (and document!) a description/model reflecting this very cash gap. This is a cash flow model, it will answer questions on this subject of interest. Everything else, even in finance (balance sheet, profit and loss) is not that important, other descriptions/models will be used to answer questions of the same or other project roles. And until you bring this description into negotiations, the financier with his interest will not be satisfied, no matter how you persuade him to "calm down". No, until you model the cash flow (or he models it himself and makes sure there is no cash gap), the financier will not calm down.

A systems thinking actor will ensure that the project work involves a manager, including financial methods work, particularly methods to prevent a cash gap. Therefore, financial description with a documented (recorded on some information carriers, not just done "in mind") cash flow description will be done for the creator organization, and this model will answer financier questions in this subject of interest as well as serve as the basis for the financier's conversation with other roles (these will be conversations of different agents and their computers, and sometimes even conversations of computers with AI, and in small projects, it will be a conversation of different roles in one head and/or computer if the agent plays multiple roles at once).

Why so complicated? Because you can simply memorize: "the financier needs a cash flow description to prevent a cash gap". But then you will need to memorize thousands of such statements — and your head will explode. Instead, you remember the way of reasoning and in each specific situation simply understand which types of descriptions are needed (and cannot be avoided), which descriptions are not needed (and, on the contrary, should not be made — just wasting resources), and how exactly to make these descriptions so that there are fewer errors. And if the situation is such that you work in an unclear role by an unclear method, you can develop new types of descriptions for yourself since you will understand how to think about "descriptions in general" (for example, you will know that in descriptions — a model and meta-model in headings, and the meta-meta-model should be "spoken aloud" to the headings, also keeping it in mind).

Now let’s repeat all this again. Alas, ontology is not the simplest subject in the intelligence stack, so repetition might be necessary. However, reliable mastering begins somewhere around the fiftieth repetition, so repetitions in the course study materials will not be enough, and all these arguments about systems modeling need to be repeated many times in working projects. Fluency will appear after creating the fiftieth table (if this is modeling in tables) where you ensure the type of description object is titled by the table, table columns correspond to the meta-model, you explicitly state column types, model values are in each row, and the modeled objects instances are in life (physical or taken from other descriptions) and correspond to table rows. This is not so long: three tables per day every other day — and you can manage in a month! There are no miracles; just reading the course material will not teach you to model. A textbook for riding a bicycle helps to learn riding a bicycle, but without real riding — nothing will work out.

"Subject of interest"/concern/"important characteristic" in the description/model (view/model) is framed by "description method"/viewpoint/meta-model, and this description method specifies what is most important in the modeled object, which needs to be considered in various models obtained using this description method. This "most important” for some model is called the meta-model,
