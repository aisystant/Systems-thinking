title: The Future and Proactivity of Activities
---

Systems thinking provides the ability to understand how to think about the future. The future is physical — it’s simply the entire physical world but concerned with its time slice not right now, but after some period. Of course, each agent is interested in something unique in the future, and this interest will stem from various roles. It’s not even certain that this is about current roles since the composition of roles will change in the future. For example, the role of a "requirements engineer" in modern engineering no longer exists; it remains only in outdated engineering methods, and the areas of interest of systems architects from ten years ago and the areas of interest of current architects differ significantly.

The possible future is determined not "objectively" but subjectively by various agents in their interactions. Current agents generate/imagine this future (construct via rendering, i.e., by adding many "realistic details" from generative world models that only contain some important patterns without details).

The opinions of agents about what they are interested in and what methods they would use in which roles also change quickly: because

- the world changes, and the agents themselves also change physically,
- agents' models of the world and themselves also change,
- the degree of confidence in the accuracy of these models changes,
- work culture also evolves, and the content of methods evolves too — the best method at a certain time requires interest in objects that were uninteresting to previous versions of the method.

Thus, for each intellectual agent (not necessarily a human), the entire future is not interesting, only what is usually interesting to the roles they play in their lives, and even those roles and interests change in the future, following changes in roles and state-of-the-art methods of those roles.

Agents playing the role of homemakers are not interested in primuses and kerogas today, and you still need to find people who know what that is — yet fifty years ago, it was common kitchenware. The course’s author remembers well both preparing dinner on a kerogas and a primus — and this was during ordinary urban life. "Pump up the primus" was regularly assigned even to children, as there was a built-in pump!

Gas later came into homes, and state-of-the-art methods of heating food for home cooking changed dramatically. And just see how the methods of gas extraction and distribution have changed over those fifty years!

The future is represented to agents as an environment for their target systems, which these agents (e.g., people) will create and develop in their future project roles. The environment consists of various super-systems. Which ones? These are described by future needs. Which specific target systems will people create in the future? This is described by future concepts of use. We learn about the future from descriptions of its target systems and their super-systems — from concepts of use of certain future (i.e., currently non-existent, unknown to us) systems according to needs that do not yet exist.

"Future studies" thus becomes system design. Design, in essence, is "looking into the future." The concept of use is developed (development now, actual use will be in the future) by the sub-role of the engineer-developer: systems engineer, and there is also the sub-role of the production technologist, who relies on the internal development system of the future, and the operator-engineer, who will or will not be able to work in that very future, while the general characteristics of the system are defined by the systems architect, who is also concerned with the future, and then there has to be a visionary who agrees that the project will be profitable and not incur losses for the development team. This does not change for near-term (days and months), mid-term (a year to three), or long-term (beyond three years — today, it’s impossible to guess even for three years!) future. Engineers always look at the future with one eye, at the present with the other. All design projects/design and projects/project — they are about the future.

Practitioners/engineers must be able to create **generative models** to foresee a detailed future, based on their (sometimes unconscious) abstract knowledge. A generative model is a model from which a reverse modeling action can be performed: generate some representations of the source modeling object, "imagine" world variants that would give the model when modeled. If it's a generative meta-model, then imagine/render/generate a model. If it's a model, then imagine/render/generate the world. And what other models are there? **Discriminative models**, they provide classification, answering the question "here's a description — what type of object is this?". Generative models respond to the request: "give an example of an object that meets the description of its type". A generative model from text (description) will generate an image (add details, remove abstraction). A discriminative model from text will tell the type of object described by the text (remove details, raise abstraction)^[<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjsZSmL67Ck>].

When you join a project for system creation and development after taking courses in systems thinking, methodology, systems engineering, personal engineering, system management, you cannot claim ignorance about this project! You know the most general features of all projects — this means you can somehow navigate this new project. If you find yourself in the future, you will also see some projects — and you can navigate them too! You have knowledge of the meta-meta-model, meaning you will quickly understand the meta-model (ontology of the subject area of your new project), the model (important about real objects), and then the modeled world itself. It doesn’t matter if this happens in a distant poorly predictable future (for example, three years from now), or right now, but in a couple of hours.

Founders as engineers of an enterprise (often called "entrepreneurs," but we avoid this term: everyone has their own set of roles under it, and some even think it's about "the psychological makeup of an agent") earn from sometimes finding themselves in the right time at the right place: predicting the future, engaging in successful (luck is important here!) envisioning::"method/practice of work" (determining in the role of a visionary, equivalent to Schumpeter’s economic entrepreneur, rather than the everyday understanding of an entrepreneur, what target system would be profitable to create, and what would not), and strategizing (determining which method/way of work will achieve the desired results). This is discussed in more detail in the course "System Management" (and materials on market economy are also provided there, since in a planned economy this all happens very differently).

Successful founders correctly (or incorrectly in the case of failure — and there are many more failures, but no one talks about them anywhere) use imagination to generate a correct picture of the future.

For example, Elon Musk founded Tesla, predicting that electric vehicles would sell well. In his world model, he considered that the cost of battery storage for electric cars would gradually decline annually, and at some point, electric cars would be more profitable than internal combustion engine cars, and he was right — around 2022, the total cost of owning an electric car and an internal combustion engine car became approximately the same^[<https://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/~/media/Files/L/Leaseplan/2022-CCI-Report_final.pdf>]. Jensen Huang, when founding NVIDIA, figured that computers could be used for graphic-intensive games — and if this developed, there would be a need for video hardware accelerators. And it happened exactly like that.

Strategizing as the selection of a collective method/strategy of a company’s operation is the leading method of:

- serial entrepreneurship (founding companies, these people call themselves founders),
- corporate entrepreneurship (sponsoring projects in project management, not only managers or founders but all employees of the company, especially in top positions, engage in this, that is, also engineers),
- creative proactive decision-making in any other activity (entrepreneurship as taking initiative, research, and creative curiosity, active envisioning).

Strategizing involves aligning the interests of engineers who can create a target system, marketers who can sell it, managers who can organize the enterprise, and fundraisers who can attract investments for it all. These are all different roles. The word "entrepreneur" can take on many meanings (including the very mundane "rich person" or even just "a person with a risk-taking nature"), which may involve performing some of the listed roles or even any necessary roles for a future company, thus calling an agent an "entrepreneur." We taboo the word "entrepreneur" due to the ambiguity of its meanings. For **Schumpeterian entrepreneur**, we'll keep the term **visionary** for the target system and **businessman** for the creation system, more details on this will be discussed in the "System Management" course (and remember that in the case of a company, there are minimally three created systems:

- The target system with its cost of creating and selling, which concerns the engineer team's role in the company. The profitability of selling the target system is here.
- The client base (all the clients) of this system with the cost of creating and selling to the engineer team and the businessman — concerns the team of marketers: role (marketing includes promotions, sales). Unit economics is here, the profitability of this product.
- The company itself with all its people and equipment. It costs something to create (investments), then it can be sold — and maximizing the sale price is the businessman's role. The profitability of selling the company is here.

All this, of course, ties together during strategizing and later during strategy execution as the method to achieve success for all these created systems. All this strategizing (defining strategy as the method to achieve success for all created systems), and then planning the strategy’s execution (planning work considering resources, potentially realizing that executing the strategy with current resources is impossible and adjusting the strategy accordingly) — this is work with the future, requiring generative/generative models and strict criticism from discriminative/discriminative models

In any case, during any project of creating and developing systems, various models must be developed, describing the target system (concept of use, behavior descriptions in tests for justifying the system's success, system concept, and project taking the concept to a detail sufficient for manufacturing, etc.) and the creation system (e.g., strategizing models — business model, organizational development model, interest alignment model).

Systems thinking implies that you will have to model (think by modeling) considering multiple systemic levels and numerous systems at these levels simultaneously. For instance, if you plan to release electric vehicles, you must contemplate the target system in its environment (an electric vehicle with its surrounding network of roads and charging stations, as well as within the electric vehicle, its most expensive subsystem: batteries) and the creation system (an automobile plant, which is many times more complex than the car itself).

If you, as an engineer, have come up with a way to manufacture a product from one part printed on a 3D printer instead of assembling fifteen separate parts, thereby saving on logistics, assembly, and quality control of 15 initial parts, this is the same entrepreneurship-in-engineering, proactivity/active life stance, creative act. The systems engineer plans the system (concept of use), invents the system concept aligned with manufacturing methods (thus involving a production engineer), and the visionary assesses the market prospects of this solution — whether it will be cheap enough to manufacture compared to competitors or for sufficient sales volume to be profitable. The businessman decides that the company can invest in creating such a system.

It's not a given that creating a system occurs as a separate well-defined project within the company, let alone as a separate company. However, if work scope raises such a question, then perhaps a specific project might exist, and a person playing many of these roles will be called a "corporate entrepreneur," and even a separate company might be created with the agent performing this engineering role also handling managerial tasks of starting the company from scratch, thus being an entrepreneur in the common sense of the term.

We will not say "entrepreneur," instead we will continue to speak of engineering (target system) and managerial (creation system engineering) roles, including special **Schumpeterian entrepreneur** roles for the target system (visionary) and the company (businessman), detailed in the "System Management" course.

For any roles engaged in changing the world (proactive/practical/cultural/engineering roles), decisions on how exactly to act are based on envisaging a successful future. These decisions are made based on a generated

- model (detailed description),
- and/or meta-model (subject-oriented abstract description),
- and/or even meta-meta-model (abstract transdisciplinary description at the level of general world views)

of such a realistic image/vision of the future that the agent finds acceptable/profitable to implement, investing their resources (sometimes also others’: investors — these are external project roles).

Strategizing develops hypotheses in the form of strategies as a set of models on optimal creator-system behavior (strategy — expectedly “optimal” method/work behavior description). Then resource planning is done, with hypotheses about plan feasibility too.

Generating strategies, producing decision alternatives, and subsequent making decisions on these alternatives is the fundamental thinking method — rationality, forming the basis of systems engineering: how to generate alternatives/options for decisions and then choose one to implement. More details are available in the courses "Systems Engineering" (rationality in engineering decision-making) and "Intellect Stack" (rationality as one of the fundamental thinking methods of the intellect stack).

The main takeaway: labor can be divided in making such significant decisions (say, decisions on building a nuclear plant or launching a spacecraft to Pluto), but rational behavior methods remain the same for any agents; only the thinking::calculation becomes more complex, more extensive thought volume involved, and it becomes collective.

But the same method of rational thinking::calculation applies when deciding to "take a break from work and have coffee". There's no labor division, the calculation volume is trivial, taking little time and involving few agents: you yourself generate/produce alternatives — take a break or not, drink coffee or tea or even have lunch, drink coffee without taking a break, take a break and just rest without coffee, etc. Then you gather information to make a decision (evaluate remaining work, check the time, recall the last coffee time, check kitchen for available coffee and tea types, etc.), and then you make a decision (this involves decision theory).

Thinking about the expected success of labor/activity/practice/engineering/methods of one's own and others' agents (both cooperating and hindering), is methodologically the same: producing hypotheses on successful methods/modes of action, choosing the most likely successful method/mode of action under uncertainty, resource planning, performing action, finding discrepancies with world models, and then refining these models and proceeding with the next iteration — generating smart mutations for hypotheses, and so on, often happening concurrently. The method remains the same for situations of:

- engineering oneself (both body and personality) as a series of steps investing oneself into some activities, learning something, training the body, acquiring skills for engaging in various project types,
- "corporate entrepreneurship," where investments are made in creating some company-needed system (engineers and managers in big companies),
- "technological entrepreneurship" (startups built around certain methods and their tools), where investments are made in creating systems that will achieve market success,
- "social entrepreneurship," investing in creating systems at community, society, or even humanity level.

**All this relies on actions oriented toward the future:** **proactivity/initiative/activity/entrepreneurship as an essential part** **of labor/practice/activity/engineering/culture/work method, consisting of rational decisions** **regarding achieving an improved future state through certain actions: generating various future scenarios,** **based on best generative models,** **gathering information about these options, deciding on one to implement,** **and then investing** **efforts, money, resources, nerves** **(if speaking of human agents), time into realizing** **this** **optimal/rational choice by** **the potential** **benefits and risks** **ratio.**

**A rational agent is willing to endure temporary deterioration of their state, depletion of their resources during some action —** **to end up in a world after that action where their state is better than expected for that same future moment when planning, without that action. A rational agent is enterprising, initiative-taking, proactive (though this was already stated in the previous paragraph).**

The most successful agents are those who creatively generate more options and then manage to rationally choose the optimal ones based on the most up-to-date accurate world models (including models of themselves!). **The defining characteristic in productive activity,** **therefore, is quality generative modeling** **of various model options,** **followed by quality differentiating/discriminative** **criticism, leading to a quality world model.** **The concern of systems thinking** **is primarily a quality world model (including the "self-model" for the agent as part of the world).**

Nearly all agents (humans, AI, organizations) engage in this "entrepreneurship" (remember, the word is taboo because it factually involves various methods adhered to by various roles), though not all choose to be company founders, business owners, thus receiving all possible profits and bearing all possible losses.

There are surprisingly many smart people, but surprisingly few billionaires: often, smart people soberly assess their chances and don’t play roulette with a continuously changing market, ongoing techno-evolution; it’s very stressful and arduous, and not everyone likes it, and even for those who do, not everyone succeeds. This will be more thoroughly examined in the "System Management" course.
