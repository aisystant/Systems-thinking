title: State Building and Public Projects
---

If a child gets hold of a hammer, then all the objects in the house turn into nails — and this means that it's not the child who owns the tool, but the tool that owns the child. If agents performing the roles of a cyber-physical systems engineer, a teacher (personality engineer), a manager (organization engineer), a politician (society engineer) get the opportunity to obtain budget funds, they will certainly take advantage of it, because it is extremely profitable: in fact, money is collected from many people under the threat of punishment for non-payment of taxes for a project to create some kind of system that someone may or may not need, or that may even be harmful to many people, and given to that one agent (individual or collective, it doesn't matter). Why not engage in a profitable project?

And there are also projects for building the state, maintaining various forms of power and the associated economies of power (i.e., forcible collection of taxes and their further redistribution for various purposes).

If a state-builder agent (it must be clearly understood that this very state-builder supports some kind of policy/strategy for the state, so he is a politician::role) becomes familiar with the system approach, systems engineering, personality engineering, management, he will certainly want to use them to increase the likelihood of achieving his interests to the detriment of all interests of competing politicians (remember that politicians compete with each other for the implementation of some shared ideas about the organization of society, competing for resources).

Systems engineering in its classic form of "hardware" and "software" engineering, cyber-physical systems engineering cannot be used for state-building purposes; it is primarily intended for projects to create and/or modernize small-scale cyber-physical-human systems (compared to state systems, aerospace projects are very small-scale). The metaphor of a watchmaker (design — manufacture of parts — assembly) is inapplicable here; this is a system of systems, it needs to be somehow grown/trained. Although it can be "trained" very quickly: for example, say, "pay taxes — and sleep peacefully” and threaten with prison for non-compliance. Everyone will learn quickly!

In the projects of classic systems engineering, even for large cyber-physical systems (airliner, submarine, rocket), the project roles in relation to "traditional" hardware or even hardware-software systems are clearly defined. Social engineering cannot be done using these methods; they don’t work with communities and societies — and these are the main systems handled by the state (regardless of the definition of "state": as a country; as all the country's officials, but without citizens; as all the country's citizens together with officials; as an object of international law, etc.). The methods of systems management as enterprise engineering will also work poorly: they will work well where the relationships of labor and capital management are clear, where bosses give orders to subordinates. In state-building, this means that you can organize management within a government organization, but you cannot establish "citizen management" along the line of management, i.e., you can only carry out "state-building-without-citizens," which may not only be meaningless but also harmful. This immediately refers to ethics: can some people control other people without any voluntary contract explicitly signed by both parties, not an "implied social contract" or other convenient fiction forcing free people to obey some other people organized into state bodies just because they were born somewhere and sometime, without signing anything like a contract.

In state-building, they mainly deal with large systems of an indefinite number of people who are little known or completely unknown to the system creators — communities and societies. Note that the creation of such engineering projects as fully hardware-software systems for citizen surveillance, effective killing systems (usually called weapons, and remember, all defense ministries in the world call themselves defense ministries), systems of tax enforcement, etc. — these are directly related to state-building projects, and they are not so much about the creation and development of "hardware" and "software" as about the creation and development of means of direct (most often forcible) influence on people, this immediately involves questions of ethics::decision-making method, and this method should be driven by conscience::role. As with any other method, the role operates not by intuition but by some method (even if there is no understanding of what the method is called — it doesn’t mean the method doesn’t exist). Conscience uses the method/way/culture of reasoning according to the ethics, the skill of performing which the agent knows.

How often do we hear about considering the interests of conscience::role in public projects, discussions of advanced ethical decision-making methods regarding the possibility of certain actions? Considering that in super-large systems, where many people interact, the consequences of decisions are harder to predict — how often is this discussed explicitly in the course of state-building?

The creation of effective gas vans in Fascist Germany — was it a purely engineering task, "nothing personal, it's business," or still related to people? It is clear that all these projects immediately raise ethical questions, as they rely on coercive (army, police, inspections without the ability to refuse inspections) methods of implementation. But inside the performers, this is just "activity," ethical questions don’t even come to mind^[[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Банальность\_зла:\_Эйхман\_в\_Иерусалиме](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Банальность_зла:_Эйхман_в_Иерусалиме)].

Who are the creators of systems from people, why do they consider themselves entitled to dictate to others how to live (or even force them not to live, as in the case of gas vans), using state machine violence — dictating their rules and threatening violence for disobedience?

A brief piece of advice here — if you need to engage in state-building, use knowledge of ethics, political science, conflict studies, law, economics, sociology, and systemic thinking in its "soft" (soft systems) forms, but don’t use systemic thinking in the forms of cyber-physical systems engineering, systems management as enterprise engineering, as you are used to using it for thinking about systems at the levels of inert matter, creatures, personality, organization/firm. These projects are usually not even of the level of a small community but of the level of society, where you personally do not know the people affected by it (including those whose taxes were taken for this and then offered to sleep peacefully).

The state and the people in it are not submarine compartments, not medical equipment parts, not even a nuclear power plant along with its staff. A pilot probably couldn’t kill anyone in a personal encounter, conscience wouldn’t allow it. But dropping an atomic bomb on a city is easy because the city is far away, deaths are not visible. **People working with the state must remember that they will have to play roles that will reduce citizens' freedoms —** **the state doesn’t grant freedoms, it primarily restricts them. This is an ethical choice** **of people helping the state.**

A project for the creation and development of systems always has quite specific external project roles that pay for this project: the project's customers (there may be many!). Who is the customer in state-building? Politicians? Officials? "The people" (e.g., described by public opinion polls or focus group results)? "The elite" (and who defines it)? Groups of experts (the "expertocracy" option — but how to choose the "right" one from these numerous expert groups, all experts argue differently and often contradict each other, substantiating very well)? Who to ask generally: it’s a terrible mess. Epistemologists laughed during the pandemic because they were confused with epidemiologists — journalists, and sometimes officials, asked for comments on what was happening. But this is a common situation, whenever encountering something unknown, one needs to find someone’s opinion. For example, you can ask a celebrity — and now famous actors and journalists (not famous sociologists) speak on political issues.

It must be clearly understood that **in the case of state-building** **and public orders** **it’s about politics**, not classic project roles in system creation. Don’t deceive yourself by saying, "There’s an order, it's paid from the budget, hence the person signing the acceptance certificate is the customer." Officials usurped the right to formulate orders and spend money on behalf of "the people," and their actions may be directly opposite to what people in that "people" would consider acceptable. It’s like if an actor from the Petrushka theatre came to Shakespeare's play "Hamlet" and portrayed his favorite role of Petrushka instead of Hamlet because "I was appointed to play Hamlet, so I play what I know."

Agent-officials, for example, may pursue their personal requests for enrichment, only simulating the roles of people’s representatives in orders, not playing the role of people’s representatives: they and their families might be interested in "kickbacks," the project might interest them as convenient for "cutting," and the results for actual state-building might not concern them at all; they won’t perform the project roles of the customer of the public project, they have completely different roles — in their personal and family projects, or even personal enrichment projects of their superiors (and then there will be a personal justification "I was just following orders" and "it’s still going to be embezzled, so let it be me rather than someone else").

But the fact that officials may not play the role of "the people" and pursue personal selfish interests isn’t the main thing. The main thing is that **it’s fundamentally impossible to play the role of the representative of "the people"**! State-building is primarily about politics, and what one person sees as success in the role of a politician will be a complete failure for another due to different ideological stances. Some believe that abortions are bad for ethical reasons, while others think they are salvation for the youth for the same reasons. Some believe that education should be free (that is, at the taxpayers’ expense), both basic, secondary, and higher, while others think that education should be paid out of pocket and not regulated in terms of content — otherwise, there will be no diversity in education, and this is bad for humanity’s development.

There are as many differences in interests (preferences for key system characteristics at some systematic levels) as there are various political groups in "the people." Therefore, state projects will be unsuccessful by definition: they will never consider the preferences of all external roles, and even these preferences can’t be honestly and fairly identified. Let’s remind that according to the definition of systems engineering, a successful system is one that takes into account the preferences in the values of important characteristics/interests for all its external project roles.

If you think something in politics is honest and fair, be ready for others to accuse you of complete incompetence, dishonesty, and unfairness — they consider something entirely opposite to be honest and fair. Attitudes toward abortions, migrants, euthanasia, progressive taxation, support for certain economic sectors, excises — there are no such questions on which there wouldn’t be directly opposite opinions.

Accusations of unethical, incompetent, dishonest, unfair behavior will always be mutual. Why do you think you are right and not the others? Why should your state project ideas be implemented by you, pursuing some goals, and not the other ideas that others want to implement something entirely opposite? From general considerations, "the others" received the same education, in general, are no more stupid, and clearly are not criminals. Why should taxpayer money be managed by you or your official customers and not your and your officials' political opponents? Especially since there are many different opponents, in politics there are many options for each possible project decision for the organization of society, and not just two options "correct" and "incorrect."

Of course, formally a public project may have a "project passport" signed by some officials (people in the roles of officials), a "collectively reviewed technical assignment," and even a report on its "successful" implementation. But this will be a "success" from the perspective of precisely these document-signing officials, but not any other external project roles. Some officials will sign some papers on the project passport as a "success," and other politicians will be picketing the same issue, writing articles in newspapers about the obvious harm of this project, and expressing their dissatisfaction in many other ways — in systems engineering and systems management ignoring all these roles is not considered the best method/practice/culture/style, such a project can’t be considered successful.

When someone's money is taken as taxes, and then spent on someone’s project to which the taxpayer disagrees with even its mere existence — this is exactly it, ignoring the opinion of the main project role, the owner of his money, even though already taken into the budget. Taken, by the way, forcefully — no one willingly pays taxes, they pay only under the threat of prison, so the lack of success starts from this point, you can’t say that "money doesn’t smell" — no, budget money smells, it wasn’t paid for services, it was taken, to be paid later.

The main project role in state-building, in public orders, in projects related to state bodies is "the people," therefore many want to say something on behalf of "the people" in the budget line and in the project passport, and also sign the report on behalf of "the people." That’s why politicians and officials talk a lot about subsidiarity, participativeness, checks, and balances, but the fact remains: by any reckoning, there are no successful projects in the state.

Opinions on success are always private opinions of some group of people with certain specific role preferences. Other people with different role interests will be very dissatisfied, and such other people always exist in "the people." But since the authorities have police power and the money of these same dissatisfied taxpayers (this money also pays the police), they can’t do anything. **It’s all politics, it’s not systems management, not project management, not systems engineering** **of technical systems, not** **medicine or education.**

**You will be building the state and organizing public projects not from your** **inanimate** **material, but always from others** **with their own brains: from other people.** **People —** **they are not iron, and not computers. Don’t believe that you will build something successful/useful/good** **for you or** **these other people by acting as a systems thinker (systems manager, engineer, or even just a programmer, or shoemaker, or cultural worker) qualified to build from people, realizing state-building ideas. These people** **as** **self-owned systems, from which you will try to construct systems of systems, are not your materials for construction, and they are not the materials of your customer-officials, customer-politicians. They are self-owned, they all belong to themselves.** And they just as much might want to build something from you — including something you won’t like. The golden rule applies here too: do not do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you.

A security engineer can protect a system from enemies (anti-clients). A state-builder engineer cannot be a security engineer unless he is building a prison. Developers of state regulation are all building a prison; they are paid precisely for this, no one ever pays for deregulation, the removal of restrictions on free activity^[Formally, state bodies have numerous initiatives for deregulation, such as reducing the list of licensed activities, reform of control and supervision, but these are just for show, merely mentioned in ideological documents: the results of this activity are almost zero for many years, there is no real deregulation.]. Think about this before building another state block that will further acquire authoritarian powers and use them to expand and gain even more power. If the order for building gas vans is profitable, it doesn’t mean you should accept this order. And no, system thinking cannot be "soft on ethics," ethics is present in all reasoning of systems thinking.

You also cannot assume that you can get help from the state in developing systemic thinking, systems management, systems engineering, systems biology, and other systemic methods (often referred to as "industrial policy," subsidizing work using some methods to increase the number of agents with some degree of mastery in these methods). Officials do not understand anything in these fields of activity. Even if they allocate money for developing any methods in these fields, or creating courses — there is no guarantee these will be competitive methods, competitive courses. These will be any (not the best! Precisely "any") methods and courses chosen by people competitive in obtaining public contracts, not competitive in providing services.

Let engineers and managers' problems be solved not by "industrial policy" but by the market, where everyone risks their money, not someone else's, not taxpayer money. The duty of officials is not to interfere in market decisions, not to support the market-weak, quietly let them go bankrupt, not to hinder the market-strong and let them earn money, and **not to confuse the market-strong and weak with administratively strong and weak —** **that is** **not to confuse** **market participants able to attract investors and clients** **with those able to attract officials**. The market effectively realizes techno-evolution, money carries signals about the viability of certain memes/ideas.

One must also be very cautious about examples of systems engineering from military projects and projects from other areas entirely regulated by the state, such as nuclear energy projects. Because in these industries the principle of budget financing "cost plus" (costs actually incurred during the project plus an agreed small percentage of profit) is adopted, only complete idiots would not gradually increase the cost of projects and timelines year by year, thereby raising the amount of profit. Look at civilian technology, its costs, growth of technical characteristics, development timelines over the past twenty years (take at least the same smartphones: twenty years ago, there were barely any cell phones, not to mention smartphones) and compare with military technology — development timelines and costs. The difference will be striking. Therefore, it should be recognized that in military systems engineering there are many interesting methodological findings, but **blindly copying this experience is not advisable: it is quite possible that you** **will also copy seemingly decent ways to increase costs and lengthen development.** In the free market, companies with such methodologies would not survive, but in allegedly military markets, entirely different patterns operate. And of course, every systems engineer decides for himself the ethical question: does he want to design and build machines for killing (this is precisely what military systems engineering does). In 2007, there was a SpaceX report at the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) conference^[<https://www.incose.org/events-and-news/incose-and-se-news/2007/12/17/space-systems-engineering-risk-management-symposium---registration-open>], but in 2020 there were no SpaceX at this conference, but many engineers from military and government projects were present. Frontier is no longer considered in INCOSE, systems thinking has gone to companies oriented towards the market, not military and government applications. Today, the state and war are associated not with progress and technical achievements, but with stagnation and inefficient spending on tools.

All the same applies to systems management: military management is clearly not an example of how management in the civilian world should be organized, although many leaders would like their subordinates to march in line. Therefore, read the books of military leaders carefully, don’t take examples from military culture at face value, don’t assume that the methods found by the military for dealing with people will work outside the barracks.
