title: Systemic Ethics
---

**Ethics** in systems thinking is regarded as a method/practice/culture of minimizing conflicts between intelligent agents concerning their actions that affect the interests of other agents. Ethics also easily extends from conflicts of intelligent agents to various conflicts of agents at higher systemic levels, consisting of intelligent agents: organizations, communities, societies, and humanity/agent-community as a whole. Sometimes these levels are referred to as "social," meaning related to many people.

Ethics is a method among the methods of the intelligence stack, and systems thinking views ethics as the leading way of reasoning about the success of systems in conditions where there are interlevel conflicts. A worker created a cannon; that's good for him — he got a salary. The enterprise received payment for the cannon. But this is a weapon of murder! The pacifist community believes that creating a cannon is absolute evil. The community of state enthusiasts thinks that the cannon may never be used, but its presence will deter potential invaders. The community of state detractors thinks the cannon should be used immediately since it exists. Most other people in society don't care about the cannon and its use. Somewhere in the UN, they try to reduce the number of cannons on the planet, "arms reductions, strengthening global security." At the country's level (its governing institutions), the presence of a cannon is "an increase in arms, strengthening national security." At the levels of communities within countries (different! Communities of some countries have opinions both about their country's cannons and about other countries' cannons) — the opinions sharply differ. What should be considered the success of the cannon's creation and development project? What is success from the perspective of some roles is a complete failure from the perspective of other roles!

In work/activity/practice/culture/strategy/engineering/method, working without ethics is impossible, and it would be better to be familiar with ethical arguments from modern (not outdated, e.g., where "infidels" can be killed freely) books than to "vote with the heart"^[Materials on ethics in Russian in some quantity can be found here, but the multi-level nature of ethics is not discussed: <https://vk.com/reducing_suffering>].

For instance, in 2022, it was decided to test how well an AI system, developed to predict the influence of molecules on the nervous system (intended for positive outcomes like drug development), works. This AI system, as well as proposing medications, suggested new neurotoxic chemical weapons (including the reinvention of already existing ones) after being asked to maximize negative effects on the nervous system^[<https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9>].

The question of the ethical use of AI, like any system, extends to uses (including self-application, by own initiative) not only of artificial but also "flesh" intelligence, human, as well as any mixture of these intelligences, and collective intelligence of groups of people and their computers. We remember that conflicts between systemic levels always exist; there are many. But there are also conflicts between competing intellectual systems of the same level. What some communities want might not be liked by people from other communities, society as a whole may have a different "average" opinion, and each individual member of these communities and societies will also want something for themselves, not willing to sacrifice their interests for the community's, society's, or even humanity's as a whole — and optimal solutions are nonexistent here.

Ethics views distributing harmful ideas as an evil — some meme-viruses lead to extremely unethical consequences when thoughtlessly executed. Here are two options: either not restricting any ideas (allowing recommendations to be of any content, "complete freedom of speech") or introducing recommendation censorship, i.e., banning the distribution of certain ideas — pyramid scheme ads, racial hatred, drugs, and the list can go on, quickly leading to political bans. In some countries, criticizing the incumbent president is regular politics, while in others, politics doesn't even exist, and criticizing the incumbent president is prohibited.

If recommendation censorship is lifted, the output will be all meme-viruses — they would be selected by recommendation algorithms based on their "infectiousness." Media and social networks choose news that isn't beneficial to people or society as a whole but is beneficial to the organizations providing these media and social networks, i.e., increasing news consumption. News like "A child with three heads was born in Africa" will undoubtedly be recommended by most "censorship-free" algorithms based on how many people it interests compared to the news "Another Physics Nobel Prize was awarded." But what if a call to kill all redheads is excellently written and becomes viral? Should such a meme be filtered or left for "freedom of speech"?

If harmful (for some) ideas are banned and useless ones limited, then should beneficial ideas be promoted instead? For instance, providing a news feed that filters out all fakes and suspicious "useless news" but offers a fascinating feed, like popular science news reformulated into captivating stories by AI? Yes, say educators. Psychologists say this is manipulation; you'll get people addicted to reading, irrespective of the content, stimulating "binge reading" — but when to work?! Whose recommendation to follow — educators' or psychologists'?

Conflicts, conflicts everywhere! Evolutionary theory discussing frustrations (multiple equally quasi-optimal system configurations with easy transitions between them) due to these conflicts says there will be no stable solutions, just endless searches for compromises satisfying no one, with many different compromises of approximately equal quality and rare improvements, often associated with the emergence of another systemic level — complexity will keep growing.

Ethical consideration should similarly be without any individual, racial/religious, or even species bias. De-anthropomorphizing ethical thinking will be beneficial even for humans. Is death ethical? After all, programmed death^[<https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04886>]— is a property of all life! One answer — no, never, by no means, and another answer — yes, because evolution needs it!

Maybe then not death, but "evolutionary modernization" via transhumanism? Transition from biological evolution to techno-evolution (genome stored outside each organism in a genetic engineering lab)?

For such an engineering solution, extending beyond narrow species/parochial ethical priorities, we face the intersection of engineering active (self- and world-changing) thinking and ethics. **Ethics in engineering thinking is always present, it cannot be discarded —** **and systemic engineering cannot exist without ethical consideration.**

If you're creating simple dining fork, spoon, and knife, they can also be used for killing — used as weapons. The next question lawyers love to ask: what is the intention? Dining, "dual-purpose," or specifically "to kill easier than to eat" (disguising a "combat blade" and "combat fork" as dining knife and fork)? The knife example isn't accidental; even manicure scissors can sometimes be taken away on a plane as "potential weapons" (something the manufacturer probably never considered!).

Another example: children can stick their hand or an iron nail into an outlet — should we ban 220 volts in home networks? Not all children will do this, only a few, and electricity is very useful for lighting and washing machines? Well, "we" (who are "we"? where are the boundaries of this "we", who is included in "we"? who expresses the opinion of this "we"? why shouldn't the holders of the opposite opinion be included in "we" and the opinion of this "we" reconsidered?) won't skimp on the price, children's lives are more valuable! Switching to 12 volts, although we understand that the losses on such voltage will be higher, and the wires will be inherently thicker! But children, children with their nail in the outlet!

There are countless examples. In social networks with billions of posts, adults can write something wrong from the point of view of some people (but quite OK from the viewpoint of many others), and then random people (like children accidentally putting their hand in the outlet) can read this wrong post. The solution: ban all billion posts in the country's internet so no one can accidentally read these few wrong posts! What, social networks are somehow useful? "We" (the same questions about "we"! Always ask them when you are spoken to on behalf of "we"!) won't skimp on the price, the wrong 100 posts per day outweigh all the benefits of the remaining 10 million. posts per day — and deleting billions of already written posts, millions of people who wrote these posts will calmly survive this!

Turning off ethical thinking (as well as systemic thinking, which directs thinking during the target system's use, even if the consideration is during the creation of the system) is unacceptable since any engineering object can be considered "dual-purpose", and besides ethics, there is no other method of comparing benefit and harm (even discussing if benefit and harm can be compared — the question of utilitarianism^[<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/>], and whether we should judge actions based on those actions — deontics^[<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/>], or involve consequences discussions by cause-effect line, consequentialism^[<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/>]). The key question here is whether your reasoning about ethical methods is mundane, or do you understand the arguments for this or that solution because you have studied some theories/explanations/knowledge/disciplines on this line, and not just "voted by heart", made intuitive decisions. And do you understand that there will be no "absolute solution" or "correct answer" in ethics, as system frustrations (analogous to geometrical frustrations) are unsolvable, the system's complexity will only grow during evolution, different variants of ethical solutions will increase in diversity, but substantial improvements will be as uncommon as desired (all laws of evolution and techno-evolution apply to ethics too).

If interests of different systemic levels are not considered, it's not modern ethics. Systemic ethics takes into account that one person's interests conflict with the team's interests (he wants to go to the toilet, but the team is holding a meeting, so he has to refrain from going to the toilet — or vice-versa, not refrain, and the team becomes displeased), the team meeting itself may be disliked by some community since the team will discuss "counterculture," and the community preserves culture. Community members know that every culture was once a counterculture; it's written in all culture books! Thus, a conflict between the community and the team exists. Society may find the community's culture unacceptable — but hold on: who exactly represents "society"? Community members may have widely differing opinions about the community and its supported culture (the community stands out from society because each member practices some work method, activity/culture/practice/style), and a significant part of society may not care at all. Reiterating: **an answer to ethics question "what is good and what is bad" is not valid if there's no systemic reasoning, i.e., considering events at different systemic levels, uncovering interlevel conflicts.**

The place of the ethics method/culture among other fundamental thinking methods of the intelligence stack is discussed in the "Intelligence Stack" course.

Here are several examples of conflicts leading to ethical disputes between objects of different evolutionary/organizational/systemic levels:

-   Humanity — we're alone on this small globe (humanity with all its people and computers, but not all agents will be humans, then transhumanistically call it "agency" or something else), but planning to spread across space. Is this ethical? Or will we "pollute space" and should commit suicide according to "green" slogans (in the case of barren Mars — "red")?
-   Society —
    catallactics^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics)]/economy,
    polity^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity)]
    (including the state). There are plenty of people eager to tell what is or isn’t ethical to do with society (including who should do it — who or what is the agent of such changes, and by what means this agent will work) on issues like state division, trade restrictions, etc., in any bar, in any pub, not to mention media editorials where journalists with their extensive readings of fiction literature hold enlightened opinions on these matters, and bloggers are absolute pros at this! Linking to territory is also discussed, and the answer is not so obvious^[text

    Or issues like health (sanitary state: lockdowns and quarantines at any suspicion of an epidemic, compulsory vaccinations, and other medical procedures prescribed without valid reasons — but who and how will determine the reasons? Courts? Experts? They lie more frequently than expected. That is, they don't lie, but two experts — three opinions, called "noise" in decisions^[There is a book on this topic:
    <https://www.litres.ru/daniel-kaneman/shum-nesovershenstvo-chelovecheskih-suzhdeniy/>,
    but it can be doubted that the measures proposed will solve the problem.]).
-   Community — disputes between different cultures and subcultures occur here. Once, the ravers (a community whose members practiced attending raves and nightclubs for collective dancing) and breakers (a community whose members practiced street dances and activities with battle contests) of Moscow disliked each other and went to each other's events to fight. This greatly displeased event organizers (a different systemic level than event participants with different goals, different views on the ethics of specific actions). They came up with an idea: leaders of both ravers and breakers unilaterally released declarations for their communities stating, "We consider it below our dignity to pick on these not-quite-people, we won't even notice them!" The texts were identical, well received by each community, and fights ceased — communities demonstratively ignored each other. This is social engineering at the community level.
-   Collective/organization working — these are projects
    (organized collectives, i.e., with clear roles and responsibilities for each). The organization is interested in paying fewer taxes, paying employees less, charging consumers more for their goods or services. And that's just part of the contradictions.
    One worker "set up" another (allowed the realization of the inherently failed project of the second worker, but the failure occurred, the one responsible was punished). How to regard this? If the first worker didn't allow the realization of the failed project — how would the second relate to him? Another example: workers make an inherently non-competitive system, everyone knows this, but no one refuses to work. The system is made, doesn't work (as expected), no money obtained for it (salaries paid from a loan), the company went bankrupt. Are the workers right? Why did managers punish the owners of this enterprise? Or did the workers simply steal their salaries? But they did work! Then it's fraud?!
-   A person who is today a rational/reasonable cyborg human. This raises countless issues, starting from relations between genders (no romance between teachers and students! Students are dependent! It's unfair love, even consensual! And no age-divergent love either — teenagers can have sex with each other, but not with adults!) to self-deception (often fully aware! Type "I'll easily quit smoking/eating at night/going to bed at dawn if I want to quit, I just don't want to"). And questions themselves: who to consider a person, competent. Children — from what age or acquired skills? Disabled — who to consider disabled? The problem of psychiatric patients (no "objective" tests in psychiatry, mostly arbitrary assessment), and just appointments. The problem of convicting criminals (or not criminals? Different communities, different societies may have different answers for the same action. Even in the same society, one year carrying a mask could get you fined for disguising your identity, another year fined for not wearing a mask during an epidemic).
-   A being — breeding beings (like, there are more cows on the planet, bred for slaughter, than might be expected in the wild), preservation of different genotypes (combatting evolutionary extinctions!), genetic engineering ("we can't wait for evolution's grace”), and here comes “the good of all sentient beings,” including the intelligence of computer agents at the ant's level: is it ethical to turn off such intelligence, or would it be “killing an agent”? Is it ethical to step on an ant? And to wash hands with antibacterial soap? It's genocide, exterminating living/sentient beings based on genome differences! Okay, what about abortions: there is no rationality/reason in human embryos yet! Even in infants, not much, what makes them so different from cats or even cows?
-   Substance — it can be used harmfully! So, working with certain substances must be banned. Uranium-235 without questions, but also gold, it’s uncontrolled currency challenging paper money! And drugs, of course, but not alcohol, or alcohol too, or not for alcohol after all. And steel, if it’s in the form of a gun, or even a knife, or it has a suspicious price in large quantities, it’s “dumping.”

Of course, this is a tiny sample of examples. Essentially, all social (individual-organization-community-society) life as a competition of engineering projects revolves around possible answers to these questions, attempts to optimize conflicts^[<https://trv-science.ru/2022/03/vsya-nasha-zhizn-zadachi-po-optimizacii/>].
But remember, due to multi-level frustrations, many possible solutions have comparable optimality, improving this optimality (successful solutions typically agreed upon at several systemic levels) is rare, the variety of solutions is vast, and there cannot be a “correct” unique solution. Plus, the level of complexity constantly increases, humanity should not be the last here, and unlikely that aliens will arrive to complicate the situation, but transhumanists can well manage this complication (actually, even the existence of two sexes or several main human races already raises questions on how many different humanities live on the planet).

Say a cell in an organism wants to reproduce uncontrollably. For the cell, it's "good and ethical," but for the organ and even the organism, it's cancer, "bad and unethical" — and here everything seems clear, as the cell and even the organism are denied reason. A person in a project wants to sleep in and not go to work, and for the team and further the collective, it’s a project failure and no salary for everyone. But should the cell obey the organ’s and further the organism’s demands (obey whom? who determines “ought to”? how does the organism decide that this hypothesis, that this must be done, will definitely be realized? Can such language of “ought” even be used regarding relations of not very rational entities?), and should analogously the person obey the team’s and further the collective's requirements (here it’s all the same, but the word “ought” suddenly gains a very definite meaning)?
