title: Student States in the Process of Learning Thinking
---

In learning Systems thinking, the student goes through the following
states. This is just an example, these student states are easily
detected when learning various methods/ways of working. Note that
the states are formulated according to the already discussed naming
pattern, similar to "the door is closed", here instead of the door it will be "the student", and what happened to
him --- will be further in the enumeration of states:

**1.** **Realized incompetence.** You::the student realized (note
that not "realize", that is, in the process, but "realized", this is like
"the door is closing" and "the door is closed"), that the Systems approach is
needed for some reason. This is the transition from **unconscious incompetence** ("I don’t even realize that I don’t know how to think systematically") to **conscious
incompetence** ("I know that I don’t know how to think systematically"). **This
is the most difficult step on the path to fluency** **in thinking, realizing your
ignorance.**

**2.** **Interested.** The student wants to spend time, nerves and various
other resources (for example, money) on learning. This state is difficult
to maintain. No motivation --- there will be no labor investment, no hard
fun^[<https://dailypapert.com/hard-fun/>]
in Seymour Papert's definition, the fun criterion^[fun --- it’s when the very process of evolving
ideas goes smoothly in terms of combining without “jitter” of explicit, implicit
conscious, as well as not yet conscious ideas in thinking (thinking with
explicit ideas --- this is "logic"),
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ2GHzFYxaI>] David
Deutsch, no metanoia by Peter Senge will occur. On commercial courses
adults come already interested, and they succeed (although not all). Young
students usually come to “lectures” uninterested --- and not all
become interested even by the end of the course. But then students often
return to study for the second time, interest appears after passing the
course: most often this happens after accidentally
using the material of Systems thinking and getting an unexpectedly
strong result. At this moment comes the desire to consolidate the success.
This interest in Systems thinking must be maintained
throughout the training.

Here we can note that in classical pedagogy, a methodologist in
instructional design highlights motivational design, and the leading teaching method is
leadership, that is, the ability to keep a person in the role
of a student^[<http://ailev.livejournal.com/1316601.html>].
If you are your own teacher, that is, you are engaged in self-education,
the ability to gather yourself and “persuade yourself to learn,” spend time on
training your neural network --- this will be your leading skill,
leading ability, “self-leadership.” You can be aware for many years that
you can’t do something, for example, you can’t dance, and want to learn
--- but never start the training.

**3.** **Well-read.** You are familiar with some fragment of the set of concepts
of the Systems approach. The material of the textbook or course (or even several)
is mastered at this stage in terms of knowing the meanings of words, being able to retell
some fragment of text, reproduce some reasoning, support
a conversation about the content of the textbook or course text. For example, you are now
well-read: you know that Systems thinking deals with parts
and wholes arranged in many levels. You know there are creators
(systems for creating systems, systems-creators). You know about the
synonym row "method/function/culture/style/activity/..." and
you can even add a couple of terms to this row, and you also remember that
you should not confuse this with “work,” which is carried out by this method. You
still do not know what to do with this and how to apply it in your projects, but
these knowledge/explanations of the meta-meta-model you already have!

It’s right to think about the state of “well-read” as a student well-read by a book on
cycling. Well-read about trips, but never having ridden himself, a student may
long tell you about balance, the need to pedal, and avoid
rocks. But demonstrating riding he cannot do.

Being well-read and seeing are necessary for thinking, but they are completely
insufficient for confident fluency in thinking. To provide “correct
well-readness,” just the part "textbook" of our course was developed.
There, the content of Systems thinking is presented and some examples of its
engagement are given. However, well-readness --- this is not even a transition to
**conscious competence**, when you can independently and consciously
conduct some “reasoning from the textbook” on some material from your
or someone else's project. From the textbook or course, we take types of
meta-meta-model, from a working project --- types of meta-model and examples
for grounding. Being well-read does not provide fluency in type
assignment operations.

**4.** **Understood.** The student understood what the terms of the Systems approach mean
in their numerous variants of different schools, can productively
use the concepts of Systems thinking in discussing various
situations. Besides memory here already appear some cognitive
intuitions, part of the necessary cognitive moves is made “automatically.”

Part of this skill is achieved by the “**sergeant
method**”^[Read more about the "sergeant method" by following the links in
<http://ailev.livejournal.com/1287293.html>.], that is
by solving simple and similar to each other, numerous
**trainer** **tasks**, which the authors of the course formulate for
training, not for knowledge control^[The main use of the "textbook" in the course is as a “help” for performing tasks
of the online course, where the main focus is on “thinking by modeling” and
“thinking by writing”. Learning occurs in the form of filling out tables
(modeling), answering questions with written explanations, performing
tasks. Simply reading the text as “text in a textbook,” alas, teaches very little.]. An example of such a task: “Peter claims that it is necessary
to start purchasing functional parts of the system, and Elena claims
that it is necessary to purchase not functional, but constructive parts. Who is
right? A) Peter B) Elena”. You can answer such a question/quiz only if
you know about the differences between functional and constructive parts of
the system --- for the answer, somehow correlate the situation in the task with
a place from the course, where this difference is discussed. After several
repetitions of different variants of the question, the answer will be self-evident, no
references to the course will be required. While solving trainer questions, just
there are “rails in the head” formed, the set of concepts is assimilated, on which
later conceptual thinking will ride.

It is important that these questions specially train counterintuitiveness,
difference of the proposed way of thinking “by the given method” from
the use of popular/common sense. Verification
of following the set, and not “any, from popular beliefs” method, is done
through the use of the **conceptual
description**^[<http://modeling.asu.edu/R&E/Notes_on_Modeling_Theory.pdf>]
(concept inventory, sometimes conceptual inventory). The verification method consists
in necessarily offering in knowledge assessments of students' questions
with trap answers corresponding to “folk thinking”. This was
proposed in physics to test the understanding of Newtonian physics in
comparison with "popular" Aristotelian physics. In Aristotelian physics, a finger
presses on a table (because it is alive!), and a table does not press on the finger (because
it is not alive!). In Newtonian, they press on each other with the same force, which
is counterintuitive, does not correspond to “common sense” (but corresponds
to Newtonian physics). Questions, composed according to the principles of conceptual
description, check --- what on this topic after the course of physics
a graduate thinks. And if it turns out that he answers questions on
Newton's third law with correct application of formulas, but at the same
believes that the table does not press on the finger, then something in the training went wrong,
and more training is needed.

Questions/quiz for the Systems thinking course are composed in the same manner:
they test systemic thinking, correctness of reasoning with
counterintuitive concepts of Systems thinking, departure from everyday and
familiar thinking of “common sense”. Again, “understood” in some
one subject domain does not yet give a general ability to think.
For example, if understood something in physics, it does not make you smarter in other
tasks^[Materials have appeared, discussing beyond concept inventories towards measuring how students think --- <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2830154/> (concerns about measuring student thinking as opposed to student knowledge, but all these attempts poorly transform into reproducible method compared to the method of concept inventory). More on this topic in the text "Notes to "Notes on Modeling Theory" by David Hestenes" --- <https://ailev.livejournal.com/1197467.html>.].

One of the students of previous versions of the course noted that his mood during
solving tasks was --- “fury”. Because his first answer was consistently
wrong, and correct answers, it turns out, were almost quotes from the course text!
And so task after task: tasks forced him to re-read the course text, reading
new and new content out of it.

No matter what the questions/quiz are, they just give the opportunity to remember
the meanings of terms and some ideas about the connection of concepts ---
no more. They will be well answered by “crammers”, who well remember the textbook text.
Situations in these questions are simple, all distractions are removed: in the field
of vision only necessary for the correct answer situations, as well as
a limited set of “thinking traps”. It’s like in a cycling textbook to ask where
the brake of the bike is --- and show several correct and incorrect answers.
Not a fact that the student, correctly pointing to the brake, can use this brake in life.
While riding a bike, all his attention and skill will initially be taken up by
maintaining balance, and the thought of the brake if it comes to mind, it is unlikely
to be implemented.

**5.** **Mastered.** The master (no longer a student) can think systematically in the wild, 
that is, in real projects, and quickly, not straining to choose
each cognitive step, as at the stage “understood”. This is a totally different
quality: to be able to solve already set tasks (even of an Olympiad level of
complexity) from a problem book versus the ability to set tasks. **Setting 
tasks** --- this is extracting from the tangled, noisy, rapidly changing 
surrounding world with a huge number of insignificant and clamoring details 
the correct objects, assigning them types, described in the textbook. After
this, you can **solve the task**, which is formulated already in terms of
the subject domain of the working situation, moreover objects for solving
the task already received types of concepts of the Systems approach. However, there
will also be needed types of other transdiscipline, and it will also be necessary to well
imagine types of objects of the subject domain itself --- the objects of these types
in life also find not just. Systems thinking --- this is just a part of the complete
thinking of an individual as a whole (including intelligence and practical skill).
Completely overcoming some work problems only due to Systems
thinking will be impossible (miracles do not happen), but much easier, than without it.
Systems thinking makes a person smarter, but not so much smarter
that quickly solve absolutely all problems.

Anyway, **in** **life there are no tasks from a textbook, no** **even words**
**from the textbook,** **in life "objects from the textbook"** **need to be** **identified,
detected, that is, set a task,** **“apply”** **book knowledge to** **life.** In the diversity
of most different objects of the surrounding world in your
project/your situation you will need to find, for example, an object of the type "target system".
But there are thousands and thousands of objects, and in large projects
such as the creation and production of an airliner project --- their many millions!
Afterward, after assigning the type of the meta-meta-model (you know these types and
what they are for because you have already gone through the state of “understood”) you can already in familiar
terms from the textbook solve the set task.

If you need to know how many apples are in two piles, you need to guess that
apples --- the type of “countable objects from an arithmetic textbook”, and not the type
“fruit: what is usually eaten.” If you want to describe the product
you are developing, then you need to identify, what objects in the world
are for it super system (that is, assign to some objects type
“super system” from our course), and what roles (also a type from our course)
of agents (people, organizations) are interested in this system,what agents
(most often today --- people) in these roles want from this system.
After this you can put forward a hypothesis as to what system (let’s call it a target) can fulfill
some functions in this super system, so that it would satisfy the interests
of the people you found (all this will need to be found in life: some
objects, which you will assign these types from the textbook/types
meta-meta-model). Then you will document the hypothesis about the target system
and super system at the moment of their
functioning/operation/use/application in the form of a use concept
(this is also a type --- a type of model, describing behavior
of the target system in its environment, will be discussed
in more detail further in the course, as well as in the course “Systems Engineering”). Real projects
in the training course appear only here, and here comes the state of
“mastered”.

Yes, you will have to engage in a work project right during the course,
this is a feature of the course. Roughly speaking, you will immediately ride not on a training
bicycle, engage in a training project, but on a real bike:
engage in Systems thinking for your work project.

Only at this stage the main skill of Systems thinking is trained:
Systems modeling as conceptual (driven by types) attention
focus on the main/important in work projects and ignoring
the non-main/unimportant. This Systems modeling as conceptual
attention focusing and holding (concentration) on the main and discarding
the non-main is needed to fight the complexity of the real world, to save
thinking. It is necessary to be able to find a needle in a haystack: to choose with your
educated/trained/tuned thinking important objects of the real
work project. Educated/trained/tuned thinking --- this is
knowing/understanding and quickly able to correlate objects of a work project
with types of a meta-meta-model/concepts from the course on strengthening the intellect, in
our case --- concepts of the Systems approach, primarily
listed in the section "Basic concepts of the Systems approach".

Then you will contemplate these objects, and the types of these objects will
suggest, what else needs to be thought about, what else needs to be considered to issue
the most accurate forecast for the future situation in the project and
plan the most effective actions that will lead to
project success.

In trainer tasks, there are greenhouse conditions,
as nothing distracts from applying the course material --- neither
abundance of insignificant details, nor the lack of important information, which needs to be found,
nor emotional involvement in the situation. For example, you
understand that you need to determine the method, which the agent uses, working
in some unknown project role. But try to figure out,
what method the boss yelling at you from this unknown for now role is using! 
Most likely, initially you will not be able to do this, will be distracted by the form, 
the yelling of the boss, the situation of a very nervous conversation! 
He yells as “operational manager”::role for operations management work::method, 
because you break his expectations for deadlines, or as
“requirements engineer”::role in the requirements engineering method, because he cannot
orientate himself in how to live in a world without requirements, as he studied long
and stuck in a long gone profession, requirements engineering as a work method having died long
ago? You need to respond to these roles differently, it’s not because of yelling 
“I’m the boss, you’re a fool”, but because of some problems in the project! 
In trainer tasks no one will yell at you, there will be time to think --- this is not like situations 
in real projects.

Trainer tasks definitely have a solution, but in life, in real
projects, the existence of an acceptable solution --- not a fact. Also not a fact,
that you are solving the correct problem. First, you need to set the correct problem
only later solve it!

“Project learning” happens exactly here, the result of assignments 
on the material of your real work projects will give the desired
metanoia: the brain neural network of the student learns to think systemically,
Systems thinking after this no longer requires conscious effort in
reasoning, including no effort required for linking its concepts to
objects of the surrounding world. This is the transition to **unconscious**
**competence**, we can also call hitting the state
“mastered” in learning Systems thinking **system**
**metanoia.** After systemic metanoia, you look at the world, 
where agents-systems create some systems in long chains, performing some
methods/practices/cultures of work in some roles, and this happens
on many systems levels. And with this view of the world, this world will
seem a bit less confusing (you already know a lot about the world! You
know the object types that you will find in this world!), there will be
slightly fewer surprises, you will make slightly fewer mistakes.

Will this help you in life? Yes, you will compete with other
agents, who will not have this advantage. And you will not become a genius, but
will still become smarter, and this will give you a certain
competitive advantage over other agents.
