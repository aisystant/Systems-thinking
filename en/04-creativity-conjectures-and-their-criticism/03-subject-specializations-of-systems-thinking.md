title: Subject Specializations of Systems Thinking
---

Systems thinking develops through its application both in "true" natural sciences (which develop explanatory theories about the world — physics, chemistry, biology, etc., in English sciences) and in various branches of engineering: from the most general systems engineering to its applied variants — enterprise engineering (management), systems chemistry^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_chemistry>, see the example of creating a replicating artificial bacterium with DNA augmented by unnatural bases <https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27329583>] (which studies not so much the behavior of molecules in reactions, but the behavior of various molecules in reaction networks, including biochemical systems — and leads to the engineering of such reaction networks), systems biology^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology>] (which goes beyond reductionist systems chemistry in studying biology and takes into account higher levels of organization of beings — macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms, populations — also targeting engineering, including genetic engineering), personality engineering (various methods related to training intelligent systems in different types of mastery, dedicated to our separate course "Personality Engineering"). Systems thinking is also being tried in social engineering, often unsuccessfully, even though it draws on social sciences. Social sciences are usually normative, meaning they prescribe "how it should be" rather than explain, and they don't consider the systemic/multi-level nature of phenomena and the unavoidable disturbances arising from the multi-level organization of society — individuals, organizations, communities, societies. One of the utopian ideas of social engineering is the construction of communism, which inevitably fails every time due to the weakness of its theoretical premises^[See, for example, critiques of socialism/communism theories in <https://www.sotsium.ru/ekonomicheskaya-teoriya/socializm-ekonomicheskij-raschet.html>, In this work, J. Huerta de Soto draws on the theory of the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism, developed back in the 1920s by Ludwig von Mises and Boris Brutzkus, the concept of tacit knowledge by Michael Polanyi, the Mises-Kirzner entrepreneurship theory, Hayek’s spontaneous order concept and his ideas on the role of knowledge in the economy.]. Nevertheless, systems thinking is being tried even for obviously flawed engineering ideas, although the limitations of such application are built into systems thinking — and as generations of systems thinking shift, they exclude the most blatant errors. For now, we advise treating ideas of engineering social reorganization with great suspicion: the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Always remember that in concentration camps, the gas chambers were the most thoughtfully engineered part, while everything else (barracks, roads) was cruder. So be careful with using systems thinking to organize how people should live according to your (or your clients') views.

There are other, less common specializations of systems thinking in various fields of engineering, where the word "engineering" is traditionally not used but in fact, it is systems engineering, based on systems thinking. For example, there is a systems thinking specialization for dance improvisation (dance engineering) Viewpoints^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewpoints>], the systems-based text "Dance Thinking and Its Development"^[<http://ailev.livejournal.com/1332624.html>] also relies on the systems approach.

In all these numerous applied engineering fields based on systems thinking, knowledge accumulates on typical engineering (hardware, software engineering, management, dance creativity, state-building, etc.) solutions for one or even multiple types of systems of one or multiple systemic levels.

But when you need to do something for the first time in the world (as when they flew to the Moon, and since 2015 SpaceX has been making the first recoverable and since 2017 reusable rocket systems, or when attempts are made to create distributed autonomous organizations DAO^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)>, this was in 2016, after this, there were many repetitions of this construction with different variations, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization>.], or since November 2022 OpenAI has been making AI based on large language models^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT>]), there are two options — to invent something haphazardly, "by intuition," or to think systematically, to somehow consistently set and solve problems, find and eliminate contradictions (systematic creativity), reduce the risk of forgetting something important in a multi-year project (system modeling and based on it configuration management^[<https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Configuration_Management>]), conducted by hundreds and thousands of people.

Systems thinking, used in methodology, helps divide the solution of a problem among different agents (for example, people) in a team, organize the execution of work by the method/"type of labor" by different agents specializing in sub-methods/"sub-types of labor." This is **division of labor**: the development along the line where the English manufactory appeared (when, instead of craft production, where all operations of making a pin were conducted by one person performing almost three dozen different operations, it became production with many people of different specialization, each of whom performed only one-two-three types of operations) and the Taylorist factory conveyor (where each worker had to do literally one feasible operation; in the limit, even disabled people could work on the conveyor, as the labor was so divided). Division of labor includes the execution of some work methods initially massively performed by people using machines (automation). Systems thinking allows navigating the emerging diversity of system creators (enterprises with a huge number of people, AI agents, equipment), which create some complex products — rockets or ice drilling rigs.

**Often** **the engineering** **solution** **and its implementation** **cannot** **be obtained in reasonable timeframes** **by one person** **or a computer** **AI agent,** **even if it's a genius person or super-genius** **AI.** **The work of large teams** **of** **many** **organized** **people together with many enhancing their capabilities computers** **and other equipment, along with the addition** **of AI agents, is required.**

For this agents, playing the roles of "hardware" engineers and software engineers, managers/enterprise engineers, investors, dancers^[An example of such a dance project using systems thinking is the systemic modeling of social multi-dance, <https://vk.com/buffdance>], government members or election campaign staff, other members of the project/organization/enterprise/"authority body"/"social initiative" (the distinctions here exist but in this context, they are not important — these are all "organizations" as system creators of various systemic levels) explicitly discuss their work methods, engage in methodology. In doing so, they not only "generate the main engineering, management, creative, political, artistic, and other solutions" but also use systems engineering methods, i.e., in their inventive activity, they develop a full **concept** **of system use, the concept of the system itself** and a number of other system models and models of systems creating this system. The professional language of applied engineers, managers, and even dancers, based on the systems approach, allows them to quickly agree on what to do and in what order when setting and addressing numerous problems during the creation of various systems — spacecraft, organizations, dance performances, professional associations, countries, i.e., everything that people do, today supported by AI agents and sophisticated equipment.

**Systems thinking says nothing about the content of thinking** **(what actions with which systems are being thought out),** **it concerns** **only its form —** **using** **concepts of the systems** **approach as types of attention objects to be used in thinking.**

Say, the type "system" (from our course on systems thinking, the meta-meta-model of the world). You need to understand which type of object in your subject area (the meta-model of the world, from a textbook on this subject area) corresponds to it. Is this system a cyber-physical device? A being? An intelligent person? An organization? A community? A society? Some of their parts? What do textbooks in this subject area call these objects, which in the course of systems thinking are called "system"?

In working projects, you also need to understand which objects in the real world (instances) correspond to these types "from textbooks," i.e., model the instance.

**Systems thinking manages attention** **by guiding it through** **the upper levels of the hierarchy** **of types/classifications/ontologies, levels above the level of subject areas (the concept of "system" from the meta-meta-model, but not the meta-model of the applied systems area —** **there will be "rocket," "plant," "mastery of not fearing spiders").** **The objects of attention themselves can be from entirely different** **applied** **subject areas, defined by entirely different meta-models** **(level of textbooks** **on explanations/theories** **of applied** **methods** **and the level of established understanding in a specific enterprise in a specific project). But all these meta-models will be typified by the objects of the meta-meta-model from our course. It will not be just "the door is closed," but "door::system is closed::state."** **And all this** **modeling (systems modeling!)** **must be** **documented/recorded, that is, holding attention with technical means, not relying on doing it "in the mind."** **If you didn't understand** **the content of the current paragraph, then** **you poorly** **understood the materials** **of the course** **"Rational Work."** **Working at different levels of abstraction/different levels of meta-modeling** **is** **the "connection of systems thinking with life"!**

In this sense, systems thinking is fundamental/transdisciplinary: it does not touch on the concepts of applied disciplines from the applied methods of work, but it provides types of important objects for the concepts of these disciplines. If the applied method of work (remembering that it is a discipline/knowledge/theory and the tools supporting it) is cooking (the theory/discipline is presented in culinary art textbooks, the tools are realized through kitchen utensils), then the target system can be, for example, borscht. The very concept of borscht — it is from the subject area of cooking as a work method with its knowledge/explanations and tools, but the fact that borscht is of the "target system" type in some project — this is already from systems thinking.

If the meta-model includes borscht::system, then in the meta-meta-model, there is a part-whole relationship between borscht and the supersystem. The types "system," "supersystem" — they are from systems thinking. What would be the supersystem for borscht? Let's say the supersystem would be a formal dinner at a restaurant (and the borscht clarifies: it's the name of one portion of borscht, not the type "borscht" as a type of culinary product). And in the meta-meta-model, there is a relationship of creation between the target system and the creator system. Then I inevitably ask, what is the creator system for borscht? Borscht::system is created by some creator system, this line of thinking is not from cooking, but from systems thinking. And then I can assume that it's the chef::creator-system (and not a housewife or cook, as I already know that this borscht as a portion will be eaten in a restaurant at a formal dinner, not at home or somewhere in the field). Systems thinking will not allow me to forget about the chef; further, one can ask questions about the degree of the chef's mastery in cooking.

If initially, I think not about the food, but about who cooks the food::creator-system, then systems thinking will not allow forgetting about what exactly is being cooked, making me think about the food::target-system, and further will necessarily lead not inward, into the subsystems, into the composition of the food, but to the supersystem: asking about what will surround this food at the moment of use. And if this is the organism of the eater::supersystem, digestion::use, then one will have to think about the dietary characteristics of the food::system — and the one who cooks the food::creator-system will have to follow some methods of dietetics/nutrition science, possibly even methods of nutritional genomics^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_genomics>]. And if in the systemic surrounding of the target system, the situation of a formal dinner at a restaurant::supersystem is found, it will still be the chef::creator-system.

Systems thinking will not let you think about the sun's reflections on the kitchen walls or the clink of kitchen utensils, the peculiarities of the tablecloth, and other not-so-important things. This may come later, but not immediately. Immediately, systems thinking will make you think about the target system in its moment of use/problem-solving/functioning in the supersystem "how it works, what it does with the supersystem" (for example, borscht brings the eater into gastronomic ecstasy, and then provides the necessary substances for digestion to the organism). After this, systems thinking will make you think about the composition of the target system (from what and how we make it, what methods/practices/styles/cultures of work are engaged), and then about the creating system at the moment of creation (who will execute these work methods).

If this sequence of reasoning **"first the target system in its environment, then what it is made of, then the creating system"** is somehow disrupted (for example, the conversation begins not with the target system at the moment of use, i.e., not with borscht at the moment of eating or at the moment of digestion), then systems thinking will simply make you refer to this consideration of the target system in its environment (in the supersystem composition) as soon as possible — and not let the discussion go further. This is the power of systems thinking: it will make you think about the important, will not let you forget about the important.

**The world is composed of some systems; they are many —** **but in the world, special systems are singled out by attention, "target," and further use the "target systems" as the reference points for attention, unfolding the shift of attention from considering one system to considering another system in relation to the target systems: from the target system up and down at the moment of its operation by system levels, and at the moment of creation from the target system along chains (or even graphs) of creation.** **In any case, attention passes through some systems, each time anchoring at the target system of the project as the start of consideration.**

The concepts of the systems approach from the meta-meta-model, taken as types, govern thinking. These types, as well as the sequence of reasoning with them, are taken from our course, learned once, and then used in all subject areas.

**When you start dealing with anything, you already know quite a lot about this "anything"! You know that there will be objects of types from the systems approach, which will make you pay attention to important aspects of the situation** **and even prompt what to think about first and what to think about later.** **For example, you must always first think about the target system in its environment, and if you haven't found it, you need to search for it!**

If the applied method of work is quantum computing, then the target system can be a quantum computer. And there will be this same reasoning: you will first have to consider the quantum computer at the moment of its use, then understand what it consists of to be used this way, then — how to make this computer (what are the methods of its creation), then — what will be the creating system for this computer. And no matter how you try to dodge answering these questions (and these are very difficult questions!), systems thinking will make you answer them. If there are no answers and none foreseen, then it’s a “dead project,” run away from it. If answers can be obtained, then obtaining them is systems thinking within the project. **Systems thinking will help not to forget the important, it will govern your attention.**

If the applied method of work is state-building, then in the subject area (domain) of this method of work, the system can be the Ministry of Attack (no state will call its Ministry of Attack otherwise than as the Ministry of Defense for propaganda purposes, but we can call things by their names here!). This means that systems thinking will literally make you think about what the Ministry of Attack does at the moment of its use (by whom? Systems thinking will not allow dodging this question. It will not allow saying “by the people” for example. This will be discussed in more detail in our course). Systems thinking will make you think about how this Ministry of Attack is arranged inside, what it is made of. And further will make you think about which methods it is created by and who will create it (who can perform the work by such methods?). These are literally “questions from the systems thinking course,” not from the state-building course. One of our students said: “I got an assignment, then I asked my boss questions from the systems thinking course about this assignment – and immediately received a place on the company’s board because I knew what to ask, what is the most important in the surrounding chaos.” And this is not a one-off but a typical story.

Systems thinking will govern attention to objects of applied engineering, where causal links have explanatory theories from various applied methods of work. **Systems thinking will** **point to the important things, you cannot not think about.** **You will be required to indicate the target system, indicate its supersystem,** **propose a division of the target system into parts in at least four ways,** **indicate the creating system or even the chain of creating systems, etc.** At the same time, the order of this enumeration matters. If you started with the creating system, for example, started describing the company’s structure, then the mastery of systems thinking will first ask, what system does the company create — and you will be interested in the moment when this system works for the client, not the moment when the company makes it. But then you will definitely ask (yourself or participants in the discussed project) how exactly this system is made by the company. And then you will definitely ask about the company’s structure, but only after answers to the previous questions. Because if you don’t know what the company does, no structure of the company will help you assess how well the company is organized to do this. More about what a systems thinker cannot ignore, about what they cannot not think about, will be in our course further.

Developed on the foundation of systems thinking, systems engineering and its applied variants (software engineering, robotics, personality engineering, systems management, social engineering, etc.) do everything so that in every working project there is no need to invent much, to “reinvent the wheel” each time. No, the goal is precisely to maximize the use of the best known conceptual (which functional parts to implement with which structural parts/affordances) solutions for the inevitable problems arising from conflicts between systemic levels (supersystem-system-subsystems — and further up and down these levels). These conflicts lead to disturbances at these systemic levels. Engineers devise various optimizations to maximize eliminate these conflicts between levels.

This also applies to creating systems, and their working methods (applied variants of engineering
