title: Scaleless Descriptions of Physical Systems
---

In discussing evolution in biology, the systems approach manifested as **major evolutionary transitions** — transitions of **increasing complexity** between large molecules and cells, cells and multicellular organisms. Similar system complexity arises in techno-evolution: transistors are made into microchips, microchips into computers, computers into data centers, and data centers into a computer network. The analogy seems clear, but a **scaleless/scalefree** **theory** (description applicable to systems of any **scale**, from the micro-world considering quantum physics phenomena, to macro-objects) was needed. Scaleless descriptions apply to systems of various scales, including both living and non-living entities, as well as conscious beings and collectives of conscious beings (e.g., humanity as a whole). Scalelessness also implied **scalelessness in the fourth dimension** — time: accounting for the system's creation time, lifespan/use time, and **evolutionary time**.

The crucial point was the **transition to formulations of physical phenomena as informational**, and explaining the **phenomenon of stability of objects in the physical world** — why certain objects (e.g., molecules or humans) maintain their **shape in space-time**. Fields, Glazebrook, Levin, Friston proposed an ontological framework of **panpsychism** in the form of **minimal physicalism** to describe physically stable systems as realizing the **principle of free energy minimization** and encompassing a full **spectrum of complexity/scales** from elementary particles to humans and societies^[Fields, C., Glazebrook, J. F. and Levin, M., Minimal physicalism as a scale-free substrate for cognition and consciousness. Neuroscience of Consciousness 2021, <https://chrisfieldsresearch.com/min-phys-NC-2021.pdf>]. **Free energy** is defined as the informational characteristic of the system, rather than traditional mechanical or electromagnetic work. These systems evolve from elementary particles to molecules, to systems of inanimate matter, to living beings, with increasing complexity from single-celled to multicellular organisms and their populations. All these types of systems reduce **Bayesian** (or **excess Bayesian**, to account for **quantum-like** computations in biology^[Yukio-Pegio Gunji, Shuji Shinohara and Vasileios Basios, Connecting the free energy principle with quantum cognition, <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.910161/full>]) **surprise** — the discrepancy between the expectations defined by a **generative model**^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model>] and actual measurements in reality.

This scaleless ontology of physically stable systems is formalized using **category theory** as a **foundational** **ontology** in terms of **mereology**^[Fields, C. and Glazebrook, J. F. A mosaic of Chu spaces and Channel Theory I: Category-theoretic concepts and tools.

A mosaic of Chu spaces and Channel Theory II: Applications to object identification and mereological complexity. Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence 31: 237-265, 2019, <https://chrisfieldsresearch.com/mosaic2-pre.pdf>] and expressed in a form allowing the description of **quantum-like active/embodied inference**^[Fields, C., Friston, K., Glazebrook, J. F. and Levin, M., A free energy principle for generic quantum systems. Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology 173: 36-59, 2022, <https://chrisfieldsresearch.com/qFEP-2112.15242.pdf>]. This line of **ontological engineering** clearly shows how to think about the functioning of systems of various evolutionary complexities, including applying **stochastic** considerations to **non-ergodic** systems, i.e., systems with memory. One of the strongest confirmations of this line of reasoning was the creation of a **hybrot**^[Hybrot, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrot>], which learned to play Pong: a sufficiently complex system capable of learning (e.g., a **natural neural network**) should, by the principle of free energy minimization, demonstrate behavior that minimizes **external environment unpredictability**, as was demonstrated in the experiment^[Brett J. Kagan, Andy C. Kitchen, Nhi T. Tran, Forough Habibollahi, Moein Khajehnejad, Bradyn J. Parker, Anjali Bhat, Ben Rollo, Adeel Razi, Karl J. Friston, In vitro neurons learn and exhibit sentience when embodied in a simulated game-world, 2022, <https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00806-6>]. In fact, this line of work formalized and mathematically grounded physics-based ontological ideas of the first-generation systems approach, yet due to the scalelessness of the theory, it can also consider other timescales: life cycles of systems and their evolution. Key to this was the quantum physics concept developed to solve the observer problem: **measurement as the interaction of systems**, not just **passive perception/observation**. The reverse is also true: the interaction of systems leading to change, i.e., creation, is described as the reverse of measurement. This means that any interaction, even a molecule as a system with its environment, can be seen as measurement or creation: the molecule is a proto-agent that somehow perceives/understands/measures and/or creates/changes the surrounding world, maintaining its stability due to adherence to the principle of free energy minimization.

This line of reasoning (perception/measurement as the reverse of change/creation and both being interactions of systems) was developed in **constructor theory**, proposed by Deutsch and developed by various **quantum gravity** researchers, as scaleless descriptions are very much needed there^[<https://www.constructortheory.org/>]. The **constructor** is a physical device that can maintain its own **unchanged/stable** state for a long time, while changing the environment through some predefined sequence of **operations** (e.g., a catalyst molecule, a robot with a universal computer, or a living being — advanced constructors can also **replicate** themselves, participating in evolution). Scaleless physical theories based on ideas of information-related **changes as computations** have proven highly productive. The constructor concept expanded the well-developed notion of **universal computation** and **universal computer** (all universal computers are analogous to a Turing machine: given enough time and memory, they can compute anything that is computable in principle, i.e., not forbidden by the principles of mathematics) to the concept of **universal transformation**: a **universal constructor** can, given enough time and materials, perform all possible transformations of the physical world that are not forbidden by the principles of physics (possibly, the universal constructor would need to create numerous copies/replicas of itself and various **tools**).
