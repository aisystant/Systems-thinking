title: Ontology of System as a Set of Descriptions for Conceptual Focus
---

People often ask for a **glossary** (brief dictionary definitions of key
concepts) of our course, ignoring the initial sections that state
**definitions** are **a coffin for a sleeping thought**. So, we will
finish our course not with a glossary but with a short text outlining
the ontology of the Systems approach (meta-meta-model), in which we will
remind you of third-generation Systems approach concepts and provide
literature on the theoretical foundations of the Systems approach. This
was discussed throughout the course on many pages, but for advanced
understanding, we highly recommend reviewing the referenced literature.

If you need not an advanced (‘graduate level’) understanding but a
‘regular student’ level, you can skip the material in this section and
proceed to study the courses ‘Methodology’, ‘Systems Engineering’,
‘Personality Engineering’, ‘Systems Management’ (in that order). If you
need to advance along the ‘graduate path’, try taking the course
‘Intellect Stack’, which provides a brief overview of all the fundamental
thinking methods of the intellect stack instead of the applied courses of
the engineering cycle.

In this section (and in the ‘Systems Thinking’ course itself), the
material from the ‘Methodology’ course is touched upon as necessary
(because when talking about **methods** and **works** engaged in by
**creators**, you inevitably need to refer to the concepts of **creation
and development**, consider **methods** of creation and **objects** of
**methods**). Partially, the ontology of Systems engineering is also touched
upon. **Systems Engineering** as a **method/approach/culture/practice**
of **changing the world for the better** is based on the **ontology of the
Systems approach** (sometimes referred to as ‘Systems ontology’, including
all concepts of the Systems approach).

There are several recent initiatives on the **ontological commitments** of
such ontology, which we consider the **third generation of the Systems
approach**, accounting for **thermodynamically driven evolution**. We
propose ways to harmonize these approaches to creating a systems ontology.

Gruber, Borst, and Studer defined **ontology** as **explicit** **specification**
**of a shared** **conceptualization** (an ontology is a formal, explicit
specification of a shared conceptualization)^[Nicola Guarino, Daniel
Oberle, and Steffen Staab, What Is an Ontology?, in S. Staab and R. Studer
(eds.), Handbook on Ontologies, Springer-Verlag, 2009]. Let's define
**conceptualization** as setting objects of perception important for reliable
**active/embodied inference**^[Karl Friston, Embodied inference: or \"I
think therefore I am, if I am what I think\" In W. Tschacher, C. Bergomi
(Eds.), The implications of embodiment: Cognition and communication (pp.
89--125). Imprint Academic.,
<https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Embodied%20Inference.pdf>]
in the world. This allows us to formulate the task of creating
an ontology in terms of **attention management**, and ‘explicit formal
specification’ here means that these objects of attention are highlighted
not spontaneously, but according to some explicit model of these objects
(ontology), specified with another model-formalism (foundational ontology). As
a **foundational** **ontology**, we choose **objects and relations**.

We solve the problem of creating ontologies and explanations based on them
(the emergence and improvement of explanatory theories that use alternative
slices of the world into objects) according to **Popperian epistemology**
^[Karl Popper,
<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/>]:
**objects** in ontology appear through **guesses**, the acceptability of these
guesses for judgments about the world is questioned, but guesses that survive
**criticism** are **taken seriously**. That is, good guesses that **the world
consists of systems** (guesses about what concepts are in the ontology of the
system) and judgments that these guesses are useful for changing the world for
the better can be taken from the literature, and if we are not aware of their
criticism and cannot immediately propose **falsification** of these guesses by
reasoning and/or experiment, we consider them **our best theories** (SoTA,
state-of-the-art) about the world, take them seriously, and further teach
**intellectual agents** (**replicate the memes** of these
**theories/knowledge/explanations/disciplines/algorithms**) so that these
guesses about objects are **shared**.

Of course, we do not just inform agents (people, AI-agents, organizations) of
the Systems ontology, but we teach them to identify in the world **abstract**
and **physical** objects described by an explicit and increasingly formal
specification as the level of abstraction decreases. The upper abstract levels
of the Systems ontology are usually represented in **distributed/neural
network** **representations**, so the presentation of the Systems approach is
not in a formal (mathematical logic) form, but in natural language text,
introducing concepts not by definitions but by their **use in different
contexts**. However, after transitioning to applied specializations in various
**domains**, representations become **local/symbolic** and are expressed in
formalisms convenient for processing by classical information technologies
(that is, for processing in relational, graph, and other databases).

Of course, if problems arise in using this ontology, it means its falsification,
but this is just an occasion to correct the ontology, fixing the identified
errors—the Systems approach ontology thus **evolves**, it at any given moment
represents the best we know at that moment. We^[School of
Systems Management, <https://system-school.ru/>]
have implemented a series of courses in which a few hundred people per week
learn to identify objects in the world described/**typed by the Systems
ontology. The main sequence of courses now realizes an approach of fully
conscious and then interiorized ‘automatic’ **conceptual directing** of
**attention** of students to objects described/typed by the Systems ontology.
The student learns how to:

-   **direct their attention** and that of other **agents** to objects from the
    explicit specification (ontology), that is, to direct attention conceptually
    rather than spontaneously, as well as **hold** conceptually directed
    attention for various durations, including collective attention in such
    agents as a team or entire enterprise through leadership or community or
    social influence (course ‘Rational Work’),
-   direct attention to **systems** (course ‘Systems Thinking’),
-   direct attention to **activities/practices** performed by
    **system-creators** (course ‘Methodology’),
-   structure **activities and roles** that must be held in attention during
    **Systems engineering projects** (course ‘Systems Engineering’),
-   teach **thinking** **skills** to agents, using both local and distributed
    representations (course ‘Personality Engineering’),
-   direct the attention of oneself and **organizations** (teams, collectives,
    enterprises) to objects described by the **specialization** of the Systems
    ontology for such system types as organizations (course ‘Systems
    Management’).

To teach students **SoTA** (state-of-the-art, ‘the best known at the moment’)
of Systems ontology, we **harmonized** several specific conceptualizations of
the system notion, which together represent the **third generation of the
Systems approach**. As usual, each generation of the Systems approach includes
all the achievements of the previous generation but adds something new.
