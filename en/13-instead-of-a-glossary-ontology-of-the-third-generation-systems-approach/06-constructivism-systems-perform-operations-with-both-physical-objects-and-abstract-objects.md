title: 'Constructivism: Systems Perform Operations with Both Physical and Abstract Objects'
---

The next thing that should be considered in the ontology of a system based on physics is the ontology of physics and mathematics itself. Such ontology is proposed in various works, but let's highlight the work of Deutsch^[David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity, 2011, <https://www.thebeginningofinfinity.com/>], in which it is proposed to consider **physics as the science of real objects** and **mathematics as the science of mental/abstract/mathematical objects, while computer science is an experimental science about evidence that the behavior of physical objects can somehow reflect the behavior of ideal/abstract/mathematical objects** (i.e., the science of **universal computers** as physical devices capable of performing **calculations/reasoning/inference**—traditional electronic, quantum, etc., including the calculations/reasoning of humans or even human collectives along with their computers). These ideas imply a shift of discussion from **models** and **data** to **universal computers** as physical devices interpreting such data and changing the state of the **environment** based on these calculations (inputting initial data for calculations and outputting results in symbolic form is just a specific case. Perceiving the surrounding world and changing it and/or "oneself" as an embodied computer/constructor is simply a more general case). Central in this **approach** will be the concept of a **creator/constructor**—a physical device that can interact with the environment, repeatedly performing some operations according to descriptions while maintaining its stability (for example, a catalyst molecule, a robot, or a human). Creators provide an approach to formally describing the second generation of systems approach: various **degrees of agentivity/intelligence** (from inert matter, robots, intelligent agents, and all their possible hybrids) create target systems based on some descriptions, and then everything can be discussed as in the first generation systems approach, that is, how target systems function in their environments.

A similar approach, integrating physics, topology, logic, and computer science with a **shift of focus to operations with objects** instead of considering objects in their static relationships, was proposed by Baez and Stay in the Rosetta Stone approach^[John Baez and Mike Stay, Physics, topology, logic and computation: a Rosetta Stone (2011), in "New Structures for Physics", ed. Bob Coecke, Lecture Notes in Physics vol. 813, Springer, Berlin, 2011, pp. 95-174, <https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340>]. After moving from describing the interaction of systems as **processes in networks** (electrical, hydraulic networks, as well as **interaction networks in system dynamics**, usually associated with functional representations of systems, i.e., representations of operational time, the first generation systems approach), Baez proposes the use of the formalism of **symmetrical monoidal category theory** to describe not just processes but processes of **open systems**, implying interaction with the environment^[John Baez, Symmetric Monoidal Categories: a Rosetta Stone, <https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/05/28/symmetric-monoidal-categories-a-rosetta-stone/>].

Again and again, we see a move towards using category theory (rather than objects and relationships, based on classical set theory ideas) as the foundational ontology for system ontology, with the main move being the transition from expressing ontology in **static relationships** to **morphisms, changes**. This intellectual move corresponds to the move towards **constructivism in mathematics**, where from "eternal classes" and their relationships we transition to **construction operations**^[Constructive Mathematics, <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-constructive/>]. This allows a **constructivist reformulation of mereology** as the central ontological discipline of the systems approach, which precisely studies part-whole relationships^[Mereology, <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/>], and since it deals with operations to create a whole from parts, constructivism also provides a path for formally expressing the ideas of creators (allowing for the description of ideas not only of the first generation systems approach but also the second generation).

This move towards constructivist mereology was proposed by Fine, whose mereology includes not only physical but also abstract objects^[Kit Fine, Towards a Theory of Part, 2010, <https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/philosophy/documents/faculty-documents/fine/accessible_fine/Fine_Theory-Part.pdf>]. It proposes **operations of constructing a whole from physical and abstract parts** (for example, constructing a set from its elements). Although Fine doesn't explicitly state it, defining construction operations (as well as category theory morphisms) as performed "by no one," these operations can easily be seen as conducted by a physical device-constructor from constructor theory, including for abstract parts—a physical device embodying a "universal computer," including a quantum computer and a living mathematician—they are computationally equivalent and physical to somehow obtain information about the input and output data of the calculation. Fine's approach allows questioning the concept of a system extending beyond physically interacting parts, since the interaction of physical parts controlled by abstract objects can be in a computer—the definition of a system as interacting parts producing emergence remains, only the interaction occurs in the creator system rather than the target system. This line allows discussing system-ness in complex cases of communities that seem to exist but are difficult to discuss based on the interaction of members of these communities with each other: interaction occurs through conducting reasoning operations about these communities in the creator computer^[Kit Fine, The Identity of Social Groups, 2020 <https://metaphysicsjournal.com/articles/10.5334/met.45/>].

This line of work on the constructivist re-description of second-generation system ontology continued with the creation of **Core Constructional Ontology**^[Salvatore Florio, Core Constructional Ontology (CCO): a Constructional Theory of Parts, Sets, and Relations, 2021, <https://gateway.newton.ac.uk/presentation/2021-04-22/29947>], which offers a constructivist view of **parts, sets, and relations theory** and serves as one of the levels of foundational ontology for **engineering descriptions**. For it, the lower level of foundational ontology is mathematics, and above it, considerations for expressing **4D mereotopology of space-time** in **4-Dimensionalist Top Level Ontology**^[Chris Partridge, 4-Dimensionalist Top Level Ontology, <https://gateway.newton.ac.uk/presentation/2021-04-22/29946>].

Using some **mathematics** (most often in computational ontology, these are variants of first-order logics, but increasingly, it's a move towards morphisms and, accordingly, category theory) as foundational ontology, bypassing all other (**upper ontology, middle ontology**) **ontological levels** is usual for **physics**. Physics itself, from the perspective of system ontology, works with **functional objects** (for example, "physical body"), whose roles are performed by different objects in the physical world (chairs, stones, molecules, photons). Subsequently, through **speculation** and **experiments**, the behavior features of these functional objects are clarified and expressed in **mathematical relationships/formulas**. With the structural similarity of formulas describing different objects, a common nature of these objects could be assumed as **analogical reasoning**. This technique is also used for ontologies expressed logically in the form of **lattices**, an example being VAE (VivoMind Analogy Engine)^[John F. Sowa and Arun K. Majumdar, Analogical Reasoning, 2003, <http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/analog.htm>]. An example of using this technique by physicists can also be works on **information theory** ("free energy" in information theory is named as such because similar formulas are used in information theory and thermodynamics^[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory>]). So there is a tendency to use mathematical objects and formulaic relationships between them to also formulate **third-generation system ontology, that is, a physical explanation of evolution leading to major evolutionary transitions.**

All this formalization, of course, is mainly related not to the direction of generating new knowledge in the course of **system creativity**, but to the direction of criticism.
