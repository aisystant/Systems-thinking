title: 'Second Generation of the Systems Approach: Target System in Its Environment, Created by Creator Systems in the Creation Graph'
---

**Second Generation of the Systems Approach** was mainly based on the ideas of systems engineering: physical (including **cyber-physical**, including cyber-physical with humans) systems are created by humans, not self-replicating in a cycle, and these systems are mostly non-living. This **problematized** the concept of the life cycle, which turned out to be neither life nor a cycle, although the **concept** remained. Thus, the second generation introduced **enabling/constructor systems**, which, in addition to the **part-whole** relationship for systems, also introduced a **creation relationship** for **creators/constructors** who create and develop the **target** **system** (most famously studied in the works of Peter Checkland^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Checkland>] in the late 70s and early 80s). In systems engineering, **systems engineering management** emerged, whose subject became the **creation and development** of enabling systems (creation **chains** appeared: creators of creators of target systems).

**Diagrams** of systems engineering emphasized the **"waterfall"** **model of the life cycle**, in which the system was **conceived, designed, implemented, tested, operated, and decommissioned**, marking the usual end of a project. In **engineering**, these tasks were performed by creators, while, in the **living system**, most tasks were performed by the system itself (part of the work was done by **evolution**, which was usually not considered). Different **roles** (roles, stakeholders) in the enabling system exhibited different **interests**/concerns regarding the system and its project, requiring various **aspectual** **descriptions**/views, made from certain **description methods**/viewpoints well-suited for discussing the diverse interests of different **project roles**.

The ISO 42010^[ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, Systems and Software Engineering — Architecture Description, <https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html>] and ISO 15288^[ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, Systems and Software Engineering — System Life Cycle Processes, <https://www.iso.org/standard/63711.html>] standards established the conceptualization of the system for systems engineering, ensuring that the second generation systems approach ontology was **shared** within engineering communities. The formalization of system ontology based on **4D extensionalism** (the idea that if two objects occupy the same **place** in **space-time**, they are the same object --- and this is a **physical object**) was proposed in 2003 by ISO 15926-2^[ISO 15926-2, Industrial Automation Systems and Integration — Integration of Life-Cycle Data for Process Plants Including Oil and Gas Production Facilities — Part 2: Data Model, <https://www.iso.org/standard/29557.html>], relying on BORO ideas^[Peter El Hajj, Business Objects Reference Ontology, <https://digitaltwinhub.co.uk/top-level-ontologies/business-objects-reference-ontology-r2/>], leading to several similar ontologies mainly for military applications, developed by the IDEAS Group^[IDEAS Group, <https://ideasgroup.org/>]. Notably, Matthew West proposed a 4D-based ontology in 2010 called HQDM^[<https://www.elsevier.com/books/developing-high-quality-data-models/west/978-0-12-375106-5>], where the system concept was central. These approaches assumed not just a specification of conceptualization but also a formal expression of conceptualization in **ontology description languages** (such as the rarely used EXPRESS^[ISO 10303-11:2004 Industrial Automation Systems and Integration — Product Data Representation and Exchange — Part 11: Description Methods: The EXPRESS Language Reference Manual, <https://www.iso.org/standard/38047.html>], and later the more popular OWL^[Web Ontology Language (OWL), <https://www.w3.org/OWL/>]) for creating **data models** in PLM system databases^[What is PLM (Product Lifecycle Management), <https://www.oracle.com/uk/scm/product-lifecycle-management/what-is-plm/>]. The main ontological premise was the use of 4D ontology, providing a good and compact description of **changes** the system undergoes during its creation from parts^[Ian Bailey, The Simplification in Integration Architecture that 4D Supports, <https://gateway.newton.ac.uk/sites/default/files/asset/doc/2105/Ian%20Bailey.pdf>].

The peak of this line of work on the engineering understanding of systems within the second generation systems approach was 2008-2013, after which interest in such **formal-logical ontological descriptions** of systems slightly declined: creating ontologies as explicit formal specifications of shared conceptualizations was no longer seen as a step towards AI development, even rebranding formal ontologies as **knowledge graphs**^[John Sowa, Knowledge Graphs for Language, Logic, Data, Reasoning, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9_kXpZAcQY> (Part of the Ontology Summit 2020)] did not help. Web 3.0, as a **semantic web**, was expected to be a future internet mainstream, but **semantic** **methods** supported by OWL-based **tools** remained niche. Ultimately, in **large language models** (LLM), distributed representations were used for generating explanations, while local (symbolic) representations were mainly handy for critiquing ideas rather than encompassing total thinking. Today, semantics includes both local and distributed representations, although the task of uniting them under one theory (neuro-symbolic computation) remains unresolved.
