title: What's Next
---

So, you have completed the course "Systems Thinking." What's next? Of course, move on to the "Methodology" course. If something remains unclear, we recommend continuing with the full "Organizational Development" program, as each new course somewhat repeats the material of the previous courses and provides examples of the concepts introduced in those courses—therefore, many questions will be resolved. Do not get stuck on the material of one course, move forward and forward.

Nevertheless, consider what benefit you can gain right now from the completed course. Just think in your projects as described in the course and its exercises (compose and fill out tables in universal modelers or even in simpler forms—lists, plain texts, this is systems thinking in its current version!), use the meta-meta-model of systems thinking. Achieve fluency in systems thinking, do not postpone it to "someday, when there is time." Systems thinking is filling out the same tables you have filled during this course; it is not something special that you have not tried before. Fill out these tables for your current projects, for new projects, do not be afraid to modify these tables. Use any modelers for these tables; it should already be easy for you to do so. This corresponds to "Project-2" from the section "Applied Functionality vs. Universal Construction," meaning you need to learn to think systematically about your subject areas (meta-models), keeping in mind the types of concepts of the systems approach (meta-meta-model)—but do it fluently, without significant resource expenditure, with long strides of thought not on a couple of concepts of the meta-meta-model, but on a dozen or so concepts at once. Remember that after a month of music lessons or training, or a month of foreign language study, the results will be "nothing"; after a year, you will significantly differ from "people off the street"; after three years, you can make money from it; and after a decade, you can talk about winning in global competition. This fully applies to systems thinking.

Why do you need to use the course material? To critique the numerous ideas generated by you and your colleagues. You will save a lot of time if you avoid mistakes as indicated in the course. You will save a lot of time if you think more about the quietly silent important aspects of a project and less about the unimportant that screams and attracts (one might even say—distracts) your attention. You already know a lot, so use this knowledge! Make a report at a conference about your achievements, write a post in the club (not only "thinking by systems modeling," but also "thinking by writing" significantly helps improve your fluency in systems thinking!).

If the material was difficult and you didn't quite understand what was being discussed in the course, try taking the course with an instructor or teacher, possibly as part of a corporate training group. Options for taking courses with teachers or instructors can be found on the School of Systems Management's website^[<https://system-school.ru/>]. Our experience shows that taking courses with a teacher or instructor and in a group of students is much more effective. And remember, if you "skipped" the prerequisite course "Rational Work," you likely didn't save time, and the course probably wasn't fully understood.

To reiterate: after completing our systems thinking course, we recommend not taking a break, but continuing your education by studying the courses "Methodology," and then courses on engineering methods—"Systems Engineering," "Personality Engineering," "Systems Management." This direction can be called **"the devil is in the details"**: delve into the study of various engineering, managerial, creative, social work methods, i.e., study separate applied work methods. This is traditional engineering, managerial, and other specialty training in their connection to real life. Systems thinking will allow you to maintain the integrity of the studied set of overview and applied work methods and transfer accumulated experience from project to project. This is the education of an engineer, manager, entrepreneur/founder of companies, artist, public figure/politician, etc., a person who has mastered systems thinking and uses it to change the world for the better.

But an alternative option can be offered, **"the angel in abstractions"** ("understanding principles frees you from understanding facts"): generalize the proposed systems thinking to enhance fluency in using its techniques and spread it to various types of systems—for the expansion of systems thinking to new work methods, new classes of systems (for example, machine learning and artificial intelligence systems, youth subculture systems, etc.). In this direction, you can deepen your knowledge of the fundamental methods of the intelligence stack, for which we recommend taking the "Intelligence Stack" course. This is the education of a person who engages in endless cognition, endless development. A good support on this path would be studying the literature mentioned in the course, especially the literature from the last section of the course (this section is of a "PhD" rather than "Master's" level).
