title: Signs of the Target System
---

The target system is discovered situationally, agreed upon by the team, and there is no algorithm or "typical situations". Nevertheless, there are **heuristics** (rules that often work but not always^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic>]), which help to find the target system for a collective project among numerous different systems in various systems breakdowns. Yes, the systems world appears chaotic with a collection of diverse subjective opinions, but humans tend to organize chaos and find patterns in it — the symbol of chaos is not accidentally quite structured:

There’s no reliable algorithm for identifying the target system; you will simply make many guesses and then criticize them to take seriously the guess that survives the criticism. To take it seriously means to act as if this guess is correct and act this way until a better guess appears, then quickly abandon the old guess and switch to the new one, operating in the real world based on this new guess. There are many thinking techniques that will help you quickly formulate and then evaluate guesses about what the target system will be in your project.

The word '**discovery**' here is not used by chance: it is believed that the target system exists, it is defined by the type of meta-meta-model "target system"::system and needs to be discovered with your attention, define its boundaries — possibly by talking to many different performers of various roles. We are not confused that we are talking about the future — in the space-time this system already exists, only in the future segment of time, not right now, this does not prevent describing the target system and its role in the supersystem today. Nor does it matter if "talking to everyone" doesn't necessarily mean learning their opinion, you can agree with them that they agree with your opinion about the target system. It doesn’t matter who exactly made a good guess about what the target system in your project is. It can be you, it can be some AI, it can be a project participant. The main thing is that the guess is stated and then it survives criticism.

The concept of usage as a description of the functionality of the system’s "black box" in the supersystem — it is not "invented", not "developed", it is discovered, negotiated what will be there with the system’s functionality, and it must be documented. It is incorrect to use the term "fix" instead of "document", that is, to secure the description. The concept of usage — is a guess, it will be clarified and corrected up to the very end of the project, changes will constantly be made to the model of the system as a "black box", nothing "fixed"!

Agreeing on the target system to then make agreements in relation to it about all other important systems, including "our system" — is to prepare the concept of usage, in which to describe the target system as a "black box" inscribed in the supersystem, satisfying the interests of external project roles. The main thing in the concept of usage — is usage scenarios, that is, the behavior of the target system in different situations presented to it by the environment. As to how the target system will be arranged — this will come later, it will already be the concept of the system. In the concept of usage, it becomes clear what in the world refers to the target system, and what falls into its environment at the time of usage. Decisions on how the system will be arranged (system concept) and how its creation and development will be arranged (decisions on the composition and structure of the creation graph) are logically made later, although usually, they are developed in parallel: the concept of usage considers the limits of the possible (so it doesn’t turn out to be a concept of some kind of magic tablecloth or flying carpet, which are unclear how to make and who will be manufacturing), but still the question is posed as "first describe what the system should do, that is, what objects in the surrounding world to bring to what state, and then — what to make it from and how it should be arranged, then — by what methods to make it, and only then — who has the skills and tools to support such methods by which the system can be made".

For example, you want to entrust some other people-contractors to create some system in your project (a creator's tool in your target system creation graph or just a subsystem of the target system), so as not to make it yourself, that is, you want to buy a ready-made system or ask to develop and make a system "to order". You formulate and document what exactly you want to buy from the contractor, this is formulating usage concepts of this ordered system (previously, based on this concept, requirements were made, filtering and distorting the information of the usage concept — that very "broken telephone"). For you, this will be a creator’s tool system in the graph of creating your target system or just a subsystem of the target system (or even all this is not the target system, but your system), but for the contractor — this will be his target system! And he will have to understand not the "system he is manufacturing" (time of manufacturing), but the "system you are using" (time of usage, and this is exactly what you will write in your usage concept of the system for the contractor).

Based on the usage concept, you make a purchase. Today it is usually not a single and final purchase, but one that assumes support — constant improvements of the system after its creation, sale, and start of operation. That is, it is assumed that you are not buying a product, but the service work for product improvement, the world is becoming not product-oriented, as before, but service-oriented.

The target system exists in the physical world, it certainly is not some description — although if you are a printing house or an art workshop, then your target system may well be a book or a painting, but you will not be concerned with what is described in the book or painting (documented description), but only with the "document", and what’s described there — these are problems for authors and readers, not yours. But if you are not a printing house and are interested in working with the content of information (what the document is about: book, painting), and not the information carrier (what paper it’s made from), then immediately look at the content, not the information carrier — the system must be sought in what is described, the system is not your description! If you say "my system is the project documentation", then you are a courier, or a printer owner. If you are an engineer busy with project documentation — then the first candidate for consideration will be the system described in the documentation.

If you are making any information models, writing texts, creating databases (e.g., developing software), drawing diagrams or blueprints, then you usually make just the description of the system, embodied in the physical world as system documentation, but not the system itself! The description, even documented — is not the target system! Ask yourself the question: what is described in the document, in the database, in the information models, reflected in the graphs and diagrams, described in the texts? Perhaps another description is described there (text, table, diagram describing other texts, tables, diagrams — objects of the mental/conceptual world, dealing with "description of the description"), but maybe your target system or at least its subsystem, or the creation system from the creation graph (systems of the physical world) will be described there. Divert attention from the information carrier (computer with software, the software itself), pay attention to the software data: there will surely be hints where to look for the target system in the physical world. Remember, if a plane assembly process is described, it is a description of the aircraft factory (creation time, creator's operations described — assembly::aircraft method::”method object”), but if you have an aircraft factory, you’ll certainly recall the aircraft (it will be the "method object" for assembly) — and further you just ask about the aircraft usage time: you understand that its place is not at the aircraft factory, but in the sky, to fly somewhere with cargo and passengers. For this very "airplane that flies with cargo and passengers," all this is done: aircraft factory, and for the factory a description of the process/method of aircraft assembly is made. The target system is the airplane, the factory — the creator in the aircraft creation graph, people-consumers do not pay for the factory, but for airline service, the airplane is a tool of the airline as a service provider, and for the factory — it is the target system (it produces airline tools, it gets paid for it).

If you say that "the system is in the physical world" — and point to the information carrier, they will only believe you if you produce the carrier itself, not the information content on it! The target system "book as a document" is not for the writer, but for the printing house or online e-book store. What about the writer? If it's an engineering project, it would be the embodiment of the world fragment described in the book. The form of the book here would not be important, but the decisions taken for the arrangement of this world fragment would be important. If it is an educational project, one could talk about creating a section of the student's brain (a specialized "wet neural network") as the executor of some method of work with the help of the book. This section of the brain will later manifest itself as a service provider of thinking (or executing some other method of work, considering not only the brain's calculator but also the body, and even tools as sensors and effectors) in some situation, for which this part of the brain was trained – and the target system here is not just "a section of the brain" but "a section of the brain at the moment it is used to execute the method." This section of the brain in its functional role as a calculator for executing the work method we call "mastery." What if considering all the mastery of an agent performing all the methods that the agent possesses? It will be the personality of the agent (and besides the personality, there will be also the organism/body). If we have an educational course, we look first not at the carrier (data center computer, teacher's brain, book), but at the course content — knowledge/theories/explanations/algorithms that describe some subject area. And there are two candidates for systems we are looking for:

-   Mastery for which this educational course was created
-   Method object described in a course (say, if the course is about growing cranberries — it's cranberries), and we treat the course as a reference guide on the method object — the system. Not all methods work with systems; some work with descriptions of systems or even descriptions of descriptions, but some method objects are systems.

Such a thinking technique/method likens projects on changing people's behavior by changing "brain software" to projects on developing computer software (one could call this "neuro-linguistic programming," but this term was already taken in the mid-70s of the last century by a specific method of such programming described by John Grinder and Richard Bandler, and thereby it became unavailable for general use^[What happened with neuro-linguistic programming and similar approaches can be seen in the links in the text "psychopractices of movement along the spectrum of formality of thinking," <https://ailev.livejournal.com/1461939.html>]. And yes, John Grinder and Richard Bandler used first-generation systems thinking and were aided by a prominent systems thinker of this generation of systems thinking — Gregory Bateson^[<https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Бейтсон,\_Грегори](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Бейтсон,_Грегори)]. This technique/method is not uncommon when modeling changes happening with people (educational projects, promotion of some products and services, psychotherapy, etc.). And remember, the target system is determined at the moment of its operation: that is, at the moment when the mastery as a corresponding functional part of the brain (implemented today by not very well-understood constructive parts, but quite material!) will be engaged in executing the work with the method the brain was taught during the training / therapy/ programming / coding (yes, the word "coding" was used!) and etc. We have already repeatedly mentioned in our course how to think about systems that are not made from separate parts, but are trained. More about this will be told in the course "Engineering of Personality," and considering that the organization also learns to work with new methods (although it is conditionally "assembled" from separate people, AI, and their tools, but still people and AI in it then learn to work by new methods), also in the course "Systems Management."

What will be the target system in a Montessori kindergarten?^[<https://www.livingmontessori.com/montessori-kindergarten-vs-traditional-kindergarten/>]. A child? So what do the parents do/create (develop and grow), him, the child? Kindergarten, a service that performs a work method on the child that the parents do not perform? Kindergarten — storage for a child where they keep him while the parents work? Heuristic: in a Montessori kindergarten, an educational process is going on, the child is taught. This means the target system is most likely some kind of mastery: a functional part of the brain that will be engaged in certain life situations already beyond the kindergarten. And the kindergarten will only be a provider of the educational service. The operation of mastery as a calculator/part of the brain — beyond the kindergarten.

Let’s say the child must be taught there the method of reasonable caution (not hiding behind parents all the time, but not rushing headlong into any available trouble), reciting verses, not getting lost in an unfamiliar environment, being collected and not losing attention. This means the mastery (i.e., the prepared calculator as part of the brain) should not just at the graduation morning party in the familiar environment of the assembly hall recite a verse from a stool, but confidently reciting a verse at some festival, where the child will be placed on an iron barrel, flashes will be from all sides, parents will be pushed aside somewhere, but the part of the brain trained in the kindergarten will activate, provide calmness, confidence, and recital of that very verse. This is mastery as a result of education, a quite material object (implemented by constructive parts of the brain). And this will be a year after graduation, the mastery must be manufactured (engineering terminology! It allows us to speak more precisely!) so that a year later the skill is not lost. All Montessori kindergarten staff should understand this: the results of their work should be looked at not in the kindergarten itself, but beyond, perhaps in a year. Well, the same applies to school, and even university, although the university provides applied education, so you can ask about situations where mastery obtained at the university is applied. But with school and kindergarten, such reasoning is more complicated: the answer is usually "we prepare for exams", and exams can be considered part of the educational process, not the use of mastery in life (if taught not what is needed, then the exam can be organized on what is not needed -- there will be no mastery in the method taught, but there will be mastery in taking exams).

Why describe it in such detail? Now you know what the target system is in your educational project (performed creative/research/entrepreneurial work, answered the question "what to teach", what mastery to teach — and the answer is more or less detailed with a list of what exactly the graduate should be able to do), and only after that should you ask questions to the creation system: what methods can create/manufacture (in our case — teach) such a functional part of the brain? How should education be arranged for the method chosen to teach? Teaching mathematics, growing carrots, and reciting verses at festivals must be done by different methods — and only after it becomes clear that this needs to be taught (for example, that children need to be taught to recite verses, spending their childhood time on this skill)!

Then discuss teaching methods and teaching situations, each time asking how this affects the result: mastery that will be manifested outside the teaching situation. And if the school says, "we teach children to pass the Unified State Exam (USE)", then one may doubt that "mastery of passing the USE" is exactly the mastery the school should teach. After discussing what this mastery should be, one can discuss methods for manufacturing this mastery: methods of manufacturing the mastery of passing the USE can be quite different from mastering the techniques of practical skills and fundamental thinking skills that a school could produce.

This turn to consider the target system not at the moment it is created but at the moment it is exploited — it is extremely important, and often mistakes are made here. A hairstyle is considered in the situation of meeting the groom, not any hairstyle at the moment of being in the hair salon, during a cut and styling, with some intermediate states of hairstyle observed. Grinding is considered at the moment of usage (after the grinding and not even at the moment of handing the grinding to the client, but the moment the client has installed the part with the grind in his system, and it works). All grinding methods are chosen so that everything is in order with this grinding usage. The same is true for teaching people and any other project situations. You must stretch your mind to the situation of using/exploiting the target system, and when negotiating the target system with other project participants, it’s necessary that they also recognize the target system at the moment of its usage, not at the moment of its creation or sale, or even setup. No, the target system must be presented at the moment of its exploitation/work/functioning/usage.

You will always have to discover the target system in a situation of insufficient information and diverse opinions about it. In each project, it will be unique, no "typical solutions" reference book or magical algorithm for its detection, only examples can be given — in the hope that these examples will not be perceived as "do exactly this", but the neural network will still notice some patterns in these examples.

**Systems thinking provides only a set of **types** to find objects in the project to necessarily think about these objects. ** It just manages attention in the project, it does not indicate how **and what to** think about **(it indicates what to think about in the meta-meta-model, but to think about at least the meta-model’s objects, it is necessary to identify these objects with the types of the meta-meta-model: execute the detection of systems, understand the systems’ relationships. For example, in an educational project, understand what mastery will be the target system ** – then everyone agrees on this mastery.) If it is **difficult for you to make a decision** about the target system**  **– it means you understand something poorly about your project, and you'd better think more, and also collect more information, talk to performers of different roles in the project.**

Documentation (paper or electronic) — is not the target system, even if it is a thick stack of project documentation for a high-rise building or the source code of a computer program, or a script of an urban festival, or some competence in someone's head. Maybe the target system — is what you describe on this carrier. Maybe you describe not the target system, but a system in the target system’s environment, or a subsystem of the target system, or a creation system somewhere deep in the creation graph. The main thing here is not to confuse systems with descriptions (even given to us as documentation). **The target system —** **is not a description! The target system is often ** **
