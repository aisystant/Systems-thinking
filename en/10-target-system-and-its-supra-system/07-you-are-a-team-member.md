title: You Are a Team Member
---

The target system is usually identified for the team of a large project and becomes known for coordinating work within the project. It's assumed, of course, that a large company may produce several types of products and they can't be represented by a single target system; this doesn't significantly alter the reasoning. The error is that the target system is identified individually in each small team, and then these small teams try to merge into one large project. It often turns out that if one team declares its target system as the "liver," another as the "intestines," and the third as liver disease medicine, they then try to unite in some project, but it will be difficult: the liver turns out to be from a pig, the intestines from a field mouse, the medicine for horse liver diseases, and the project is suddenly about treating a human. No, here the target system will still be a healthy person, with a sick human liver at the start, and the creation graph will be built based on this target system. Veterinary divisions will either be repurposed or excluded from the project as unnecessary, regardless of how much they insist they're systematically identifying their target systems. Their systems are not target systems, and generally only a few people in the project might consider their systems as target systems, while for the rest it's selfishness, an attempt to pull the blanket over themselves.

Remember: the target system is introduced not as something "objective," but to coordinate work within a complex creation graph to understand what all these people, AI, and organizations are doing, and what should appear as a result of the project.

**Systems thinking** **will** **coordinate** **project activities** **of various agents in various roles using various methods, not just provide** **thinking superiority of some** **agents** **over others. This is not a combat/sport thinking** **of competition and victory** **(although it helps to win in competition),** **but rather thinking** **of agreements and** **cooperation.**

As a "team member"/"internal project role," you are not necessarily working on the target system as a whole. You might be developing a subsystem for the target system, or even a subsystem of a subsystem, or creating some creator (tool or even an organizational unit with people, AI, and tools) within the creation graph— but it will be just your personal opinion that you are working on a "personal target system," you can keep that opinion to yourself.

You are working on "your system": this is, of course, also a system, but simply not a target system, but important to you and your team. Within the project, in communicating with your team, you will discuss the subsystem or even subsystem of the subsystem entrusted to you, or even the creator of some subsystem within the target, or even the clientele as a system. You can certainly call such your system "my system," and this will not confuse anyone, it's purely true. But do not require the team to acknowledge your system (a system that is only an engineered system for you, a small cog in a large machine, or five subprograms in a huge software complex, or even the entire company engaged in the release of the target product/service or providing service for other target systems) as a full-fledged target system for everyone. No, you have to do three things:

-   Confidently name the target system. If you don't understand what the target system is, then whatever you bring to the project, whatever you do—it may be unnecessary. Therefore, let's first understand together what we are doing in the full project to create the target system, and only then deal with your issues in your mini-project.
-   Confidently name your system, and here everything is the same as for the target, only it concerns you or your small team in the big project.
-   Do not forget that your small project is needed only for the success of the target system. Therefore, make an effort to show the cause-and-effect connection with the success of the target system in what you are doing and occupied with.

Thus, a top manager may have three projects: A, B, C. And spent a week dealing with project B. At this time, he calls project B "his system." Let's check:

-   Does he confidently name the target system for which project B ultimately works? Or is he historically engaged in project B, which is no longer needed?
-   What about his system? Is "Project B" the behavior of the project's working group? Then the project is not a system, and it's a mistake from the start. We change the understanding: this manager's system is the organization: the project B team, "the working group of the project." It's better already, but if it's a top manager, it would be better if his system for the project was considered to be the product of the project B, and if it's about service, then his system is the system whose state the project B team changes with their service. The focus must initially be on the result, not on the creator, and on the creator only after understanding the expected result! Excellent, now this looks like systems thinking.
-   And here's the third point: it is necessary to show the cause-and-effect connection that the manager's engagement in project B will somehow help the release of the target system. Either the quality of the target system will be better, or the cost will be lower, or objections from some external roles for the entire project will be removed (not the system of project B), or the release speed of the target system will increase? To do this, one needs to understand where this manager's system is located in the creation graph and provide the cause-and-effect linkage, the rational justification of the decision. If it turns out that nothing in the target system will change, then the manager has wasted time on nonsense, a trifle, a hobby. He needs to justify why he wasn't working on A or C, but on B. For this, one can refer to the justification from the viewpoint of the theory of constraints (operational management, in the course "Rational Work" you are familiar with the modern version of this theory, TameFlow^[<https://tameflow.com/>]).
    A troubling sign here would be that while dealing with B, the manager confirms that his actions will have no immediate effect on the target system, and he’s making "preparations". "Preparations" are harmful, they are dead capital, and work in progress, and operational management fights against these "preparations", this is the introduction of risks into the work. This **link between "our system" and the "target system" through the chains of production relationships and part-whole relationship—** **it should** **be presented, and the time spent on engaging in "our system" (one of all possible project systems)—** **should be justified.** **Why did you engage in our system, and not some other, not helping the neighbors, for example?** **If the connection is not presented,** **and the time spent on our system is not justified,** **then you cannot tell whether** **this** **work is beneficial or harmful.**

You may also be involved in developing a creation system (for instance, implementing a project to develop some organizational unit: hairdressing salon), that is, you won’t be directly dealing with the target system. But that doesn’t mean you should call the hairdressing salon the target system for the entire project. Throughout the project, you need to create hairstyles, and in your project—to create a hairdressing salon. Do not confuse these two projects, do not consider them as one. You shouldn't consider that the target system for you is the one that will be the creation system for everyone else. No, your target system is the same as everyone else's, which is changed by the works of creation systems, including those creation systems that you are making in the work chain, i.e., your systems. You are in a project to create hairstyles, so explain how your actions with the hairdressing salon result in creating hairstyles. For example, increase the production of hairstyles in an existing salon, or expedite the production of hairstyles in a yet-to-be-launched salon, or provide for the production of a more profitable type of hairstyle, or reduce the cost of the hairstyle production process, and so on—everywhere here it's important that the discussion is about the hairstyle, and if there's no hairstyle in the reasoning, then your work on improving the hairdressing salon will be immediately questioned.

If you are organizing an airplane factory, the target system is the airplane, if you are consulting the organizers of the airplane factory, it's better to consider the airplane the target system rather than those organizers! The airplane that flies (in the moment of exploitation)—this is the target system, so explain how you achieve the airplane flying and flying well, and being cheap. If you are consulting the factory organizers—how do your consultations help the airplanes? If they don’t, then without your consultations, everything will remain the same—unless you’re consulting not the airplane factory organizers, but, for example, owners of some stock packages they want to redistribute. But then the factory has nothing to do with it, it's about consulting an investment project, and things must be called by their proper names—this honesty will help everyone.

As in maps, each person does not build a map with polar coordinates around themselves. Agreed on a planetary scale about the North Pole as the origin of coordinates—and everyone on the planet uses a single reference system, the pole doesn’t hop around on the whim of any one person or even one team of travelers, it's common to all. The systemic approach recommends just such an approach: to agree on a common target system for the entire large project team. And all agents agree on joint activities, showing the cause-and-effect links of their work with the success of the target system.

**The project team—** **it doesn't necessarily have to be a project group under your control! Most likely,** **"you"** **in this** **"we"** **occupy** **a few** **role positions, doing part of the large task, not keeping the whole system in mind, but engaging in some separate practice/culture/type of work** **(thermal engineering, management, programming, choreography), or some part of the system, or the clientele of the system.** **If you have part of the** **whole** **system, or a system in the creation graph—** **this will be** **"our system"** **for a small team or** **"my system"** **for you personally.**

For it, one can and should fully unfold systems thinking, just as for the target system, except it should not be considered or called a target system. The first step here is to find the real target system for the whole project (as usual in systemic thinking: look not into the details, inward, but from the boundaries—outward, in this case, from the boundaries of "our project" outward, into the large project of creating the target system). The target system needs to be identified to determine the place of "our system" relative to it—and then agree with everyone about our system (qualification of "practices" in organizational development) and even engage everyone (qualification of "master" in organizational development).

It is necessary to carefully identify the target system, with the choice of which all project participants will agree, synchronize actions relative to which everyone will do, and then deal with that system closest to you (or the one most needed by the project right now—if you’re a top manager, and justify why you're dealing with some chosen system rather than neighboring ones).

A big mistake is to consider yourself an objective and neutral systems engineer, systems manager, a sort of systemic knight, all in white with a halo over your head leading the team to the project's success. Not at all, it’s not so. **Systems thinking is often needed precisely to raise** **your** **awareness:** **to allow** **yourself to realize what roles you have in** **the large** **project of creating** **and developing** **the target** **system, what methods you’re working with what subjects of these methods, what skills you need and tools, what are your** **role** **interests,** **what is your place in** **the large** **team** **and authority over resource management** **of the large** **team,** **which subsystem of the target system** **of your** **large** **team** **or subsystem of one of the many creators** **in** **the creation graph** **of the target system** **you’re dealing with.**

There are no recipes here, everything is determined by the current situation, there are no algorithms on this topic—but there is a set of objects for a meta-meta-model that sets the list of important objects of the project, which you need to think about and then agree on on the scale of both the big team of the entire target system creation project (e.g., mechanical watches) and your private project (e.g., the project of creating and developing mechanical watch hands).

The project team can be a couple of thousand people employees of the enterprise, or it can consist of a couple of people, and sometimes even one person. Although, in the case of one person, thinking systemically may seem excessive, but look at the multitude of external project roles, look at the multitude of creators::systems (for example, organizational systems-creators: your contractors, suppliers of tools and equipment, providers of various services), and you will not think that you are so lonely in the project allegedly "for one," even if you alone will perform all the numerous internal project roles as engineers and managers, performing all the work methods needed for the project’s success. Considering external project roles, thinking in the project will still be collective, not "personal," you will have to make agreements with external project roles and bring them to agreements among themselves.

Division into external project roles and the team can be even more granular: internal project roles of the *enterprise* (legal entity) as a "big team" and the team of the organizational unit (separate project or division within the *enterprise*) as a "small team." Internal project roles of the enterprise as the big team (e.g., the enterprise’s financiers, lawyers, operational managers) are interested in the success of the target system but actively pursue entirely different interests than the small project team for its "our system." If you suddenly have an extra \$1000 in the project—where would you spend it? This is not a trivial question:

-   Improve the target system by this amount without increasing its cost—i.e., gift it to the client?
-   Improve the team's resources—hire more qualified people, buy more expensive equipment?
-   Allocate dividends to the enterprise owners? Spend on the needs of the "small team"?

The interests of all roles differ, and these interests can be towards different systems—and actions to pursue these interests thus turn out to be different, often very inventive, unexpected for others. It would be better for all of you in the project to agree before these actions start, or the active realization of the most unexpected strategies of the most unexpected agents begins. But for this, you need to understand that “agreeing in the project” means agreeing on improvement regarding the target system release. If your connection to the target system is unclear, then you are an outsider, there’s no trust in you, agreements with you have weak force—and will be immediately broken if it turns out that for the project's success as a whole (success of the target system), it’s necessary to engage in something else.

Usually, many would want to complete an obviously failing project, as the project roles unrolls wish to get a salary and care little about the project’s result. Actors would gladly play their roles in an empty hall: whether the theater gets money for this show, they care little (the management will still pay), and the fact that there are no spectators, even better: they can skimp on role performance! The same happens with obviously failing projects. **Systems thinking helps to realize that the project** **in terms of the target system's success** **is failing, and then insists on an ethical review of the situation.** **“Our project” may not be failing! But ethically, it should not be done if it doesn't lead to the success of the target system.**

You need to collectively/group agree on what to consider the target system, what goals the project pursues, what are the project's possibilities. And also need to understand which collective/group agrees to create and develop the target system, it’s often unclear at first. But first, you need to still figure out what the target system is, and then with "we": if you don’t understand what we are doing, it’s unclear who is involved in this doing, who "we" are, who with what mastery (and even with what level of mastery, it’s also important) will be needed in the project, and who came just to eat up/chop up resources, not lead the target system to success, contributing nothing, or even causing harm.

Changing what you/you call the target system every five minutes is wrong. **Relativism** (when everything is considered subjective and relative, wobbly and uncertain—there’s inherently no reference point, any fifth-grade student is esteemed in his opinion about building a nuclear power plant, any savage is honored in his choice of the target system, and they all change their opinions every five minutes without agreeing with anyone) in thinking won’t help. Agreement on the target system must be achieved based on some principles, not arbitrarily, and for a sufficient time—preferably not changing the target system during the entire project, although understanding of what this target system is might be constantly refined. Of course, in business, there is also the pivot scenario, when a startup changes the target system. But don’t be deceived: during this "pivot," everyone understands which new system they will engage in. And not all "we" in these projects survive the pivot.
