title: Examples of Services and Their Providers

You don't have to articulate types from the transdiscipline of systems thinking, as we do here in the textbook: "fruit apple," "furniture chair," "system airplane," "service-provider hair salon," etc. In life, it is important just to pay attention to the types of objects (keeping these types in mind silently) to ensure the correct identification of important objects from the diversity of surrounding objects and to check that you are performing the right operations with these types (not expecting a description to be a creator, not expecting the target system to be an enterprise, etc.).

The question is about memorizing a checklist of types, thinking about the objects they categorize, highlighting them in your work and personal projects. All these types from our course are interconnected by relationships, and it's easy to latch onto these relationships in your thinking, transferring attention from these relationships and types of the meta-meta-model to the specific objects of your project.

If you have identified the target system of your project, it must be surrounded by an environment and function/method/service (here, a long series of synonyms) in this environment. It must also have subsystems, each with their own function within the target system. And there should be a creator/constructor, often more than one—a whole graph of such creators—a creation relationships graph. Yes, we mention the systems thinking mantra again, albeit briefly.

All this works iteratively, and the relationships are traversable in different directions. If there is some creator, it will (possibly through a long chain in the creation graph) inevitably have a target system and its supersystem. Our system might, in general, be some third system (for example, a subsystem in the target or a subsystem of some creator in the creation graph).

If you do not distinguish all these types of systems in a project, you will miss out on important objects. If you have a project for creating a training course (say, you want to onboard, introduce new employees to your organization), then there has to be a target system—mastery (say, mastery of proper conduct within the organization). If you have a delivery system project (delivery service provider), it is a creating system, and the target system is a "delivered parcel" (handed to the recipient, not "in transit"). The key point here is to identify all these systems and ensure the project team understands what these systems are, even if you do not each time pronounce the type from the meta-meta-model (saying, "we're all doing haircuts here, our hair salon is only for haircuts, not for its own sake" instead of "our target system is the haircut, our hair salon system is only needed as the creator of the target").

Only geniuses can remember everything they need to on time and "by intuition" (though they can't either, they are just ordinary people). Systems thinkers are usually not geniuses, so they don't act "by intuition": they use the enumerations of systems approach concepts as checklists for their thinking objects.

Types of concepts from the systems approach (e.g., those proposed in our course) are useful in learning but then also in discussing within work projects what has been thought about and what should be considered. You should also go talk with knowledgeable people in the project and beyond (with some you can converse by reading their books, articles, regulations) because much need not be invented but discovered; look in the world for objects of the type already defined in our course, not just "any objects" that catch the eye. "Any" objects can be either important or unimportant. Objects of those types addressed by systems thinking are most likely to be important. Their types and importance seem trivial, but try asking your team members what is being created and developed in the project (in our terms—the target system, and in a small team within a large project—"our system"), and you will be surprised by the diversity of opinions. How can anything be created and developed quickly and effectively under such universal disagreement?

The small nuances of each project (e.g., differently organized project team) make a big difference in how conveniently various systems are highlighted in the project. Each time for each project, you need to do the work anew to identify the target system and our system, determine the required services, and apply all systems thinking. Therefore, below are not "typical situations" and "thinking algorithms," but just examples. Take them as a starting point for reasoning and be sure to adapt.

Let's consider the simplest example: a project fully equivalent to creating a hair salon (we said that service situations at the meta-meta-model level are all equivalent, objects are typed by the same types and linked by the same relationships)—but you will be making a grinding workshop. Amazingly, but people rarely dealing with grinding think little about exactly the same issues that come to mind when they think about well-known situations like haircuts in a hair salon, simply because everyone is familiar with a hair salon, but not with a grinding workshop. And this "thinking about the important when it is missed"—is where the strength of the systems approach lies, the very concepts of systems thinking, the types from its meta-meta-model (system in its kind variants, function/method/service/culture, work, role, agent, etc.) here are key prompts, a checklist of "what to think about," "what to tell when asked what we're doing," "what to ask to understand."

A grinding workshop as a provider of grinding services has what target system? Grind: that very worked surface finished by the grinding services (a physical object! Grind as a target system occupies space, characterized by its roughness, contacting the body of the grindable object on one side and another system in the environment on the other). Thus, the grinding workshop in general (or the grinder within it, depending on your project) is a system for creating grind.

It is imperative to consider the supersystem: why are we grinding? What will come into contact with the grind, or does the grind just need to shine for beauty? Should the grind be covered with varnish so it doesn't oxidize? What is the class of surface treatment? The significance of these questions will automatically come to the mind of an experienced grinder. But we are not experienced grinders, and we need these questions to come to mind as well! Systems thinking provides exactly this, forcing us to think:

- about the target system (it's not simple to grasp that it's the grind—though it is fully equivalent to the "hairstyle" in the case of a hair salon, just instead of cutting and styling—grinding and polishing, and instead of hair on the head—a surface layer on the workpiece),
- and about the supersystem (the grind in contact with the workpiece on one side and something else on the other side),
- and the needs of external project roles (why are we grinding? What does the supersystem want if it has the grind?)
- and the concept of using the grind (what behavior of the grind we want to achieve when it is used in the supersystem, what is expected of it?),
- and the concept of the grind (what will the grind be like, will there be any additional coatings, sprays, varnishes?),
- and how to justify the result (how to ensure that all interests are satisfied?).

If it is about a grinding service, think also about the functions of the grind creator (note that "functions of the grind creator" is synonymous with "grinding service," as well as "the method of the grinding workshop"), which will be performed regarding the workpiece of the target system in the supersystem for creating the part as a whole: the function "make a shiny surface"—for this job you can simply paint the surface, nickel-plate it, or even cover it with shiny foil; "make a smooth surface"—for this job too, you can offer several methods other than grinding.

How they choose to turn to the grinding workshop:

- first, determine the final state of the item by method/service/function,
- and then choose from a range of possible methods/services/functions/practices.

Another way to say the same thing but in a bit more detail (close to the systems mantra):

- first, define the functional object as the subject of the method ("smooth surface" and determine the properties of smoothness needed in the environment of this method subject at the time of use),
- and then offer a constructive object to embody the functional object (grind on a workpiece, smooth paint layer, applied plastic film, etc.), the surface concept.
- Next, think about what service/method/way can be used to achieve this (grinding! And the method subject for grinding is the grind. From this point, "smooth surface" is specified: "grind"::“smooth surface”).
- Next, think about who can be the creator, that is the provider of such a service (the provider of the grind creation service can be a grinding workshop, or even a grinder, or even manual grinding, although in the latter two cases "our employees, our tools," we continue talking about the method, but in the first case "external workshop" we talk about the service).
- Choose the constructive object, performing the role of the grinding workshop (e.g., LLC "Whrrr").

Systems thinking will also make you think about external roles (engineer::client who needs the grind), internal/team::role (who will grind?) and external to the creator::system (who needs the grinding workshop, but not the grinds themselves). It will force documenting the interests of external project roles and the grind usage concept (describe the grind's supersystem—what external project roles expect from the worked surface plus what adheres to it), the grind concept itself, which provides the expected properties (surface treatment class, the necessity of some coating after grinding, e.g., varnishing: how to ensure those grind characteristics that are important at the time of use).

The same reasoning needs to be done in other cases. So, you create a business trip processing system, and you suspect that your client here is the accounting department. Systems thinking drives through the following reasoning (more detailed reasoning about the administration services are given in the course "Systems Management," they are typical for almost everything related to administration):

- Since we are talking about software (although we don't yet know if the "business trip processing system" includes people, or is it an organizational unit, or just a software tool without a separate org unit for it), this software describes something in its data. What does it describe? A trip, or in formal language—a "business trip." So, the target system (for which everything is started, including processing through your future software) is a business trip, understood as a composition of quite material objects: a person (not necessarily an employee!) who travels somewhere, a starting point, an ending point, transport, a travel document (ticket, description of the trip), a place of stay, a stay document (receipt, description of "staying")—and all this on some time segment.
- Now refine the target system. Three candidates for target systems emerge: 1. Remote work (the trip doesn't matter here, the point is to achieve some changes in objects, although these changes are impossible without the trip). For example, a boss instructs an employee on remote work, or the employee decides that work needs to be done. 2. The business trip itself—as the employee defines it. It includes performing work and the trip itself—transport, overnights. 3. The formal part of the business trip—this is the object of interest to the accounting department: only those parts of the trip that are somehow related to payable (not all) transport and payable (not all) overnight stays. In most administrative-related situations, you need to distinguish similar three target systems.
- The client here is not the accounting department, but those who need remote work (e.g., managers of those traveling) and the business trip (the travelers), the accounting department turns out to be a subordinate role of the external service provider for the creation of the formal part of the business trip. So, then you need to decide: is this software a toolset for the manager to process remote work, for the employee to help with the trip, or for the accounting department to process the formal part of the business trip.
- If you understand whose toolset the created software is among these three and support managers and employees first, and the accounting department last (and not vice versa—convenient for the accounting department processing method but inconvenient for managers and employees as clients of the accounting department, then driving managers and employees into an inconvenient service under the threat of taking their money and nerves, thus saving the nerves of accountants), the project team with the results of its work will be needed first and foremost by all managers (who want remote work) and employees (who want to go on business trips), and not only the firm's accountants, who need to process these trips but don't really need them ("could not process—didn't go, the consequences of failing to complete remote work are not our, the accounting department's, concern, so shut up and follow any stupid processing rules"). This significantly changes negotiating positions in the project! From the enemy of all managers and employees, the team developing the toolset (software for processing remote work/business trips) becomes the friend of all managers and their employees! And they all join forces against the accounting department, for whom zero trips (zero work on providing the service, and it's not a classical service, they're not paid for it!) is ideal/preference, as it reduces their worries regarding processing. Such role reversals are typical when systems thinking is involved: you have to honestly answer the question of who needs what and negotiate a balance of interests for the created system, whatever it may be. The help from the types of the meta-meta-model is that the objects regarding which negotiations are to occur become understandable (the negotiation subjects, usually the subjects of some methods used by negotiating agent-roles), and it is clear who to negotiate with.
- What working methods need to be employed so that the target system "the formal part of the business trip" is created, brought from the state "the formal part of the business trip does not exist" to "the formal part of the business trip is created," then through several stages "the formal part of the business trip is completed"? What exactly needs to be done, i.e., in what way to change the state of which objects (but so far, do not consider the agent: who or what will carry out work on these methods)? The creator using the tools (accounting staff with software, but we already discovered that you should consider travelers, their managers, and even cases of "self-boss," self-send on a business trip) should register the need for a trip and open a mini-project of remote work, allocate funds for the trip (and there may still be part of the funding for the work itself!), buy tickets, possibly book a hotel, issue per diems, process documents (business trip certificate, tickets, hotel reservation, shipping documents for any equipment being taken), accept the trip report—and there are many variants depending on the adopted business trip methods. Somewhere business trip certificates are unnecessary, somewhere even reports are not needed, somewhere lawyers protect employees more, somewhere lawyers insist on the standards for business trips from Soviet times (when air travel was extraordinary).
- Which creator should execute these methods? Software (and there the software creator is a team of programmers, "the creator of the creator"), or a service/service provider of processing (software on servers plus accounting staff working with this software as operators? The terminology "service" and "service provider" will only be used in this case, but even here the variants: the more external the service, e.g., an external service provider of accounting, the more suitable this terminology, but if these tasks are done by employees of the same firm processing trips for other employees—the word "service" for the working methods or "service" for the people with their skills and software-tools may not be heard, "the language resists")? What will be considered success for the software creation project, service creation, business trip creation? What roles are required for these different projects of creating the creator of the business trip (creating the processing service, then creating the software), the business trip creation project (and we immediately found the service operator, the manager of the traveler, the traveler agent—but the roles of programmers and service managers were left in the previous service creation project and there inside software creation)? Who performs these roles in the team of programmers, the team creating the service managers, the team creating the business trip (even if there is no sense of a team in this final team and no one considers it a project, it is still a project, and many people participate, they need to negotiate and be able to play their role). Trouble comes if you consider "our project" to be the software creation project, and at the time of project acceptance, or in the moment of difficulties from lack of performers of other roles in the full-fledged processing service team (system creation time) they will ask the current software developer! Explanations that "we thought only the software was needed from us, and someone else would take care of the people," nobody will listen! Ultimately, fully processed business trips, or even complete business trips (where employees manage to dine in an unbillable restaurant or spend the night in a hotel that did not issue any payment receipts) are important. If they fail due to business trip or processing issues, these are "your internal issues, but report on completed tasks!" Only the expected overall results of the business trip count, and if some service processing people are lacking or the software itself cannot provide them, you will have to "create" these people too, i.e., train additional people to new working methods, and also train new working methods to managers and self-sent agents too!

Notice, everything said about the project of creating software for trip processing does not give a clear answer to the question: how to organize trip processing. But it shows how systems thinking gives a set of objects convenient for discussing alternatives. You can't avoid discussing what exactly needs to be discussed. You need to discuss systems, their environment, external project roles, creation graphs and creators within them (as a tool, as providers/services or just individual or collective agents), working methods, roles, etc. —thinking involves objects of not just any types, but these types specifically, and these types are taken from the courses "Rational Work," "Systems Thinking," "Methodology," "Systems Engineering," "Personality Engineering," "System Management," and other fundamental (on methods of the intellect stack, for example, "Intellect Stack") and applied (on engineering methods) courses.

Another example: a store provides a purchase service—it creates a purchase as a set of items in the ownership of the buyer in their hands upon leaving the store, and the buyer's money in the store's accounts (thinking of money as gold, we can ignore the non-physical nature of cashless transactions). The store helps to make/create/produce (engineering terminology!) the purchase: it connects the buyer with its shelves and cash registers.

Important: distinguish two meanings of the term "purchase":

- Process/method/service, shopping—store's working method, changing the state of goods from "laid out on the shelf" to "became goods in purchase," and money "in the buyer's wallet" to "payment for the purchase." For example, "to complete the purchase, click the 'pay' button."
- Goods that were purchased and ownership transferred to the buyer's hands. For example, "unwrap your purchase, let's see what you bought."

If it is an online store, then "purchase" in this meaning becomes alongside the payment "delivery," and there's the same confusion delivery::method/service goods::"service object" and "payment"::money service::"
