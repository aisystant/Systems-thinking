title: First to find the target system
---

The first thing to do in systems thinking is not to ponder all
systems at once and make profound declarations such as "everything is a system, and everything is interconnected." This is true, but there are not enough resources to think about all systems simultaneously, and connections vary in importance. Therefore, systems thinking helps to think not about all systems at once but rather to identify the most important connections between systems.

Unfortunately, "managerial versions" of systems thinking from one-and-a-half generations ago suggest that it is important to think a lot but do not explain how exactly to think: they do not provide a thinking method. These "managerial versions" are detailed in the most published and popular books by foreign authors on systems approach in management, published at the end of the last century (when reading literature, always check the publication dates!).

This "managerial version" can be conditionally attributed to the "one-and-a-half" generation of systems thinking because it speaks of creation systems (enterprises), but engages the first generation of systems thinking: "everything is very complex, the system-enterprise consists of parts, non-trivially connected, and the enterprise itself is in a very complex world." Unfortunately, it is simply proposed to "think more, think more thoroughly," but it is not explained how exactly—except for the clear message that it would be good to add holism to reductionism and always think about the environment first, and then about the system itself. The message is correct, but such advice is of little use.

To get immediate and direct benefit in a collective project, it is necessary to understand that systems thinking should quickly bring everyone together—and for this, it would be good to understand why everyone is gathered here in the project. For this, it is necessary to identify the main system which you want to create and develop from scratch (greenfield) or to develop/modify (brownfield) in the project. In other words, the first step is to first identify the system in the creation graph for which various creators unite through thinking in the relation of creation. This system is called the target system, and without agreement on it, it will be impossible to agree on everything else.

**First** **in a project** **it is necessary** **to agree on what the**
**target system** **(system-of-interest) is: understand its function in
the metasystem and its boundaries, name it so that it can be discussed
further.** **This is very difficult,** **as it involves**
**creative/entrepreneurial/proactive decision-making, high-risk
modeling of an uncertain future.** **Different resources will be invested
in the target system, so it should be successful—** **achieving benefit,
rather than loss; and benefit is understood broadly here, not necessarily monetary gain.**

Most often, the target system at the moment of agreements has not yet been created, the project is just starting, "nothing is yet known"—but systems thinking says that this is the reason to think: what are we creating, what will we develop? But if you get it wrong and do not come to an agreement, all project participants will create different systems—and the project will fail, resulting in the fable about the swan, crayfish, and pike fish.

It is especially important not to miss the point that if you are creating tools for a method (e.g., Software-as-a-Service, a server application, or tools for a service), the target systems are those to which you apply these tools, not the tools themselves. The saying "nobody needs drills, they need holes in the walls" is precisely about this, the focus should always be on the systems processed by your tools, even though the hardest part is creating the tool. Creators are often much more complex than the systems they produce. Building a factory for mass production of cars is much more difficult than building a single prototype electric car in a workshop, regardless of the cost of building that prototype.

To create a tool, you need to understand what you intend to process with it, what exactly you are creating with it at the moment of its operation. This “created by the tool” and “created by the enterprise” is often the target system. But "often" does not mean always, and this requires further investigation.

Most initiated system creation projects fail, and we do not know about them only because failures are not publicized, successes are! The system needs to be created now, and for this, its success in the future must be predicted. But it is generally impossible to reliably predict the future, one can only guess—and often it doesn't work out, at least not on the first try, it requires several attempts. You must have some kind of "generative model of the world," and you will need to model/render/imagine your target system based on this generative model with unclear accuracy and details—this is still a "guessing" in the end.

You must guess the target system rather than "calculate it according to a formula" or "derive it by an algorithm." You then need to criticize this guess, try to improve it if it turns out to be worse than other guesses, and eventually pick the best one available (so usually many guesses are made, and only the one surviving criticism is taken seriously, that is, forming the basis of the system creation project).

About the target system, it is said that it is “discovered” during strategizing. Strategizing is when you come up with/discover a method to improve your specific situation. This working method, which should help you, is called a strategy. Often, strategizing boils down to saying that your strategy will improve the situation by making a particular class of systems, for example, you will create: "work method" cars: "result of the work method," will "trade electricity": method with result— "transaction," will "teach": method "golf players": result of the method. Implementing the work according to the devised method (implementing the strategy, getting the result) should lead to an improved situation.

Success means that no one will take the result away from you, there will be no dissatisfied people, you will gain resources, not losses from implementing the strategy. So the target system is what is created during the execution of some strategy: the method (usually strategies for some collective agent—an organization where everyone has agreed on how to use the resources to achieve the result in the work of the strategy). Of course, at the core of the strategy is a guess/hypothesis. Sometimes, this guess/hypothesis is called an "entrepreneurial bet," as in gambling, because it is only a hypothesis that the team will win in implementing the strategy—the guess about the target system and the working methods to create it may turn out to be incorrect, resources will be invested, but there will be no "improvement of the situation"/benefit/"exceeding income over expenses with discount consideration." Sometimes it is also scientifically called an "entrepreneurial hypothesis" (and assessing its accuracy at the start of the project is the role of the Schumpeterian entrepreneur, which in our courses is shorter called "visionary").

If you are not fluent in systems thinking, you will define the target system incorrectly not only because you poorly predict the future but also simply due to lack of thought. You will lose objects requiring your attention in your thinking, and this will bring risks to the project. For example, if you define the target system as a behavior—no one will understand you, you will not make agreements with anyone. A typical phrase: "my target system is software development," and no bell rings in your head that "development::method" is not a system, the verbal noun usually refers to functions/methods::behavior, and implicitly mentioned software as a system and the creator of the software as another system, but we remember that with software it needs to be understood, whether it is just the program, or also look at who creates an organization that uses software to achieve the desired result. And additionally "my target system"—is it really "mine"? The target system is needed to reach an agreement with everyone, not for you to agree with everyone. Although, if you are the only investor—no problem, "my target system" will do, you will hire everyone else, but still, you should not call behavior a system, the hired ones will imagine any target system —and the project will fall apart, collective thinking won't happen.

If you define the target system incorrectly, you will simply be engaging in the wrong activities, wasting your time: the focus of your attention will not be on the important but "close to the important" or even "far from the important." **Systems thinking** **is about** **consciously** **managing attention, keeping that attention on the important, defining types of objects in the systems approach—even when lazy, not want to, when thinking is hard.**

Systems thinking requires coherence (and computer-assisted support: systems modeling results should be recorded to avoid the chance of forgetting them). For example, if you made a guess about the target system, systems thinking immediately says: "look from the system boundary outward, into the metasystem. And don't think about a transparent box yet, especially during creation. First deal with the time of use, with the black box). It is hard—to withstand this comment, but without it, you won't understand what you need to do, what creators will be like, and what working methods these creators will use to create the system. It is difficult because it usually refers to the very start of the project when almost nothing can be said about the target system, but systems thinking demands to tell what it does in what environment, why it does it and why anyone would need it. This is a literal adherence to the systems thinking mantra.

The success (including commercial success) of the created system cannot be only "designed" and thus guaranteed (the uncertain future will always make corrections, studies show that the share of luck in the success of large projects is greater than the share of the same intelligence, this is detailed in the "Systems Management" course in the strategizing section). Nevertheless, luck can be present—but there is always a chance that it will be missed due to thinking errors. Systems thinking helps to avoid thinking errors in their most likely places; it helps to agree with very different people achieving mastery in different professional project roles and thus forewarns of different risks. These errors, systems thinking helps track throughout the entire project of creating and developing the system. You will repeatedly have to conceive, design, manufacture, test, and operate, and modify the system over and over, discard/liquidate unnecessary system instances, close the creation and development project due to the exhaustion of interest in the system—and systems thinking demands that you and all other project participants clearly understand which system is being discussed, so everyone can agree.

Timely noticed signs of potential project failure to create the target system give the project team a chance to respond, including responding by closing the project—investing resources in a knowingly unsuccessful project is unacceptable, and **systems thinking helps detect the need to close the project sooner.** **Systems thinking acts as the forest's sanitary inspector: it immediately kills obviously doomed projects, saving everyone's time, nerves, and money.** If you realized that ERP software is being created, but a department that will use the software for enterprise planning needs to be created, but nobody is concerned about this department, everyone is only concerned about the software—this is a failure, leave such a project (if you, of course, don't think you can take the money for a useless project, and someone else will be responsible for the wasted money—that is ethically acceptable for you. If not—either reorganize the project or leave).

Systems thinking also helps to find ways to continue a project heading toward failure, increasing its success probability—it suggests what to think about first, where to spend time contemplating the created and developed system. Systems thinking does not so much help overcome problems (come up with ways to solve problems) as it timely identifies problems, draws attention to them (literally: it is about managing attention!). Systems thinking is more associated with criticism than with guessing. Systems creativity involves guessing followed by criticism, so systems thinking tells only on what to make guesses (but does not provide a guessing method) and then helps criticize these guesses. Systems thinking itself cannot invent but can suggest what to invent—and then criticize if it turns out that you invented something wrong.

What should be done if you have determined the target system, but the guess was wrong? Then systematic creativity: found conflicts and contradictions need either to adjust the current guess or to come up with a new guess. And here it is necessary to remember that there is no single correct solution, there are many solutions, but all are suboptimal, and the best among available solutions are roughly equal in quality (unsettledness). Radical improvements, "genius guesses"—are rare!

Entrepreneurship/proactivity/activity (activity here as opposed to passivity) is understood in fundamental thinking methods not necessarily in the classical economic sense of the word (that is, systems are created and developed is not necessarily for making money, investing resources today at a low cost to get more tomorrow for processed resources that have higher value). But in any case **the doer/practitioner/worker/engineer,
doing** **something, performing some work/project,**
**estimates its success:** **tries to imagine the future world where the project's result (system) exists—and tries to understand/learn** **(including actively, "active probing," conducting experiments in the physical world, asking questions, etc.—** **this is not** **"understand theoretically," this is conducting full-fledged research/learning with experiments!). Project participants must jointly imagine what the results of different project roles will look like—** **that is, to evaluate whether the project will be successful.**

Projects can be very different. Someone may dance ("make oneself an artist-dancer"—do not forget that behavior is always related to some systems to be created), but even in this case, one must think about the performance being successful: the success of a dancer's performance is determined not only by the dancer's own perception. In some countries, dancing at funerals is not accepted, while in others it is accepted—with a coffin on the shoulders. It is necessary to look at the circumstances of the dance, not just the dance performance as a system related only to the dancing artists. And is only the artist-dancer a target system at the moment of performance, or is the artist during performance only a subsystem in something bigger. The artist-dancer is part of the performance as a micro-event, but we can go further—what is the performance part of? Festival, party, concert? Maybe collective agreement is reached on this, not on the preparation and teaching of the dancer to the artist level and the target performance?

Systems thinking will not provide answers to such questions, but it provides types for you to ask such questions in your project—and as a result, quickly collectively agree on what you are creating and developing as a team. Also, note that the composition of agents in this "you" may differ significantly depending on which project you are thinking about, which project you consider yourself a part of. And if you are a part of several projects, they may conflict, for example, two projects may both urgently require you to dedicate 100% of your work time to them, and you need to explain how you spend your resources and why.

Projects vary significantly in scale. For instance, someone may conceive a cultural revolution, imagining a community or even society that behaves differently than it does now—and this will be their target system. It remains only to find project participants for whom this same society will be the target system with the same characteristics (which will need to be agreed upon).

In any case, the project needs to realistically imagine what (which system) will be the result of the project. Moreover, it is necessary to follow all systems approach prescriptions: to not only assess what the target system will be and how it will behave during operation, but also the environment of this target system and the impact of the target system behavior on this environment, and what external project roles will think about this influence of the target system on the environment, and what the agents playing these roles will do if they like the project and if they do not. And we are not even touching on the systems in the creation graph yet! But these systems need to reach an agreement, this project result assessment (the target system with its function/method of operation in its environment, satisfaction of external project roles interests) must be common among the creators, and since the discourse is not only on creation but also on the development of the system, this project result assessment should be conducted throughout the entire project, not just at its start.

The entrepreneurial/proactive/creative/research nature of any activity in the project arises because all strategies and implementing plans are merely "forecasts" /hypotheses/guesses, and they are not "objective" (one does not guess them as "natural laws") but a subject of agreements (one guesses them as to what will be easier to agree on), plus agreements can "be renegotiated," the future cannot be accurately predicted, and the class will be correct but unlikely to be correct for long.

This uncertainty forces both engineers-techies and managers as engineers of the organization with these engineers-techies, and investors in these organizations, and politicians engaged in higher-level systems, to think again and again about how the target system will eventually be used in its environment and what other effects may arise from this use, to keep attention on the situation of using the target system and tracking what is happening around this use, even though this usage is in the future.

All engineers create and develop their systems imagining them working already at the conceiving and designing stages—without this, there would be no engineering! There would be no classical engineering, nor enterprise engineering, nor social engineering! The uncertainty of the future does not negate the necessity to have a generative model (i.e., a model from which you can generate an image of the future as an option for realizing the target system in it with some parameters), from which you must necessarily generate/render/produce an image of this future and envisage all possible pleasant and unpleasant surprises in this future!

In systems thinking one should always think of the system in its systemic environment (time of use!) and about the opinion of external project roles throughout the entire creation chain (external project roles should be ready to pay for creating and/or upgrading the target system and its creation systems, but also remember those external roles who will consider the project unethical, no matter how much you are promised for its implementation. Creating gas chambers can be paid for well, but will you take up such a project?). If the system is of no need to anyone (i.e., no one needs its behavior in the metasystem, no metasystem needs the function of this system sufficiently to cover the creation costs), if the system is knowingly unsuccessful for commercial or ethical reasons—it is usually not made. Or it is made when someone is ready to pay for moral satisfaction. Cases where "one is ready to pay, but not their own—e.g., stolen money or taxpayers' money," we do not consider.

Before trying to assess the system's success, it needs to be found/discovered. This is strategizing,
entrepreneurial/pro-active/enactive part of engineering/activity/labor, and it must be conducted collectively.

In systems thinking, the target system is like the origin point in mental "polar coordinates." All other decisions of various roles about identifying other systems—metasystems, systems in the environment, subsystems, creation systems—are made in relation to the target system. To understand what decisions are being made about, first agree on the target system. And success is also determined in relation to
