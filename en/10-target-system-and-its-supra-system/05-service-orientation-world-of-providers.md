title: Service Orientation. World of Providers.
---

The shift in thinking from delivering products as target systems to providing
services (performing instances of services/methods by the provider/supplier of the service/method on someone else's object of work)
has proven very productive and is referred to as
**service orientation** in modern terminology. We see more and more providers ---
"Internet providers" come from this very concept, "suppliers of internet access service."
The subject of their service, also the target system, is "internet access,"
implying a certain physical state of the customer's and provider's equipment
enabling data transmission between the customer's equipment and the equipment of all other customers of all other internet providers in the world who have "internet access."

Software suppliers that operate as cloud-based tools processing other people's data by some method use
the SaaS business model, software-as-a-service. Here, one must consider that in
information technology, service is often seen as a server
(microservices are essentially microservers rather than microservices as
functions/methods of servers); at the very least, it is an inanimate "machine,"
but not a method/behavior, the method can generally be omitted in discussions, and
it immediately proceeds to "calling a service" as conducting the provider's work,
the method of this work is not discussed separately. We always try to clarify what
the interlocutor means when they use the term "service," remembering the multiple dictionary meanings of each term! Software-as-a-service is software that provides a service, software here is a service/server/service provider.
However, the provider can also refer to an organization that has
the expertise to provide a service, and the software here is the tool. If it were
a workshop where knives are sharpened, the consideration here would be the same ---
"machine-as-a-service" one could bring their knives, just as in SaaS the data is brought and sharpened like the data is processed in SaaS, and retrieve the knives after sharpening as the data is retrieved after processing. Payment is only for the execution of the
service/work; there is no need to pay for the knives or the data.

All projects transitioning from goods/products/items to services
(service orientation) are similar in how to think about them. Service orientation
has begun affecting traditional products and items, i.e., physical objects manufactured as "goods" --- meaning that goods suppliers are also transitioning to service supply business models (more accurately, server supply by the method of service).

For example, let’s take cast iron ingots, "foundry gray cast iron":

![](05-service-orientation-world-of-providers-48.png)

Taking service orientation into account, the service would be "supply,"
the subject of service would be "cast iron" (cast iron ingots) and it would be better to say
"supplying cast iron," since typically leaving too generic words in the names of
"work methods"::"behavior patterns" (supply, development,
manufacturing, creation, purchase) does not allow for a substantive
conversation; it lacks specificity, at least to the level of meta-model,
the subject area.

Verbs are usually few and very general; this transfers to derivative
nouns (-ing form of the verb in English), they are few and very
general. Therefore, for specificity, the objects of the methods indicated by the verbs are specified --- the specifics of the subject area are introduced with the terms of the method objects, not the terms of the
methods/functions/cultures/methods/strategies/services themselves.

The transition from "selling cast iron" to "supplying cast iron" increases the
capabilities of the enterprise, transforming it from "supplier of own goods" into a "service" or "provider of access to cast iron": the cast iron product remains the same --- but if you focus not on the cast iron itself, but on the method of supply, the states of objects in the subject area of the supply can change significantly. The specification of cast iron includes the specification of the supply service, "supply conditions" (in the service-oriented approach, this is often referred to as SLA, service-level agreement^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement>]).
Just in time^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing>] supply for production,
through enterprise stock or directly to the remelting point, maintaining a minimum stock throughout the year or just a large batch delivery, credit possibilities upon supply, third-party firm supply, etc. — there are many variations
of the "supply" methods for the item "gray cast iron."
Thus, by these service supply variations, we significantly expand the range, although the service subject (cast iron, which will eventually be "supplied," transferred to the receiver's ownership) remains the same.

Services/functions/methods are usually easily recognized in the language --- they are gerunds with a hidden verb (behavior), although remaining used in speech as a thing. If the action/process is "to teach," the service will be "teaching." If the action/process is "to supply," the service will be "supply." In English, services are usually expressed with verbs in their ing-form. However, one should not be misled by the high level of abstraction in the names of the method/service (teaching, supply). Remember that both the object and the method are usually specified: teaching Braille, teaching dancing, teaching Systems Thinking uses entirely different methods, but the term in the method name will be "teaching." Supplying freshly made hamburgers, foundry cast iron, boxed software also uses entirely different methods, but the term in the method name will be "supply." Be interested in the objects of the method, as well as demand specification of a particular method variant (for example, "cleaning" could be for a pipeline and teeth, "teeth cleaning" could use different tools --- "ultrasonic deep teeth cleaning," "toothbrush and toothpaste cleaning," "flossing teeth"). Clarify: both when you speak and when you are spoken to about methods/services/cultures! If you don’t clarify, you will probably be misunderstood, or you will misunderstand your interlocutor. Always choose the right level of abstraction for discussion!

The transition from "things" to "behavior," changes, dynamics proves to be very productive, hence service orientation rapidly displaces product orientation. The Windows 10 operating system was already considered by the firm Microsoft not so much as a product (target system that is delivered to the client), but as a service, i.e., a method/culture of keeping the product constantly updated (the target system as the service object, i.e., Windows 10, belongs to the client, but Microsoft changes the versions, adding new features and fixing bugs --- improving the target system with its external behavior). Microsoft has turned from a supplier of "boxed" software tools into a software service provider. Transition to Windows 11 in practice just meant a marketing event, a name change, since nothing fundamentally new was introduced: Windows 11 in practice is just the next version of the same service from Microsoft. Further, Microsoft transitions customers-buyers of the former boxed MS Office product to the SaaS business model, i.e., from office software as "goods" it provides only its external behavior, making the server/cloud MS Office (now Microsoft 365) its tool, placing this software in its data centers, leaving on the computers of client-subscribers/service subscribers (and not boxed software buyers) only the familiar MS Office interface. The subject of this service is the client’s data (note that methods/services work not only with systems, but also with various objects of the method/service domain, which we call subjects, and which can change their state from initial upon entering the method to final after applying the method --- client data changes its state from initial to processed output after applying Microsoft’s software::provider’s::creator’s tool. Subjects, not target systems --- methods/services can work with descriptions as well).

Service orientation wonderfully expands potential markets: there are not many types of methods in the world, a few thousand (hence there are only a few thousand verbs in languages), but there are millions and millions of different kinds of things (hence there are millions of nouns). Thinking about methods/services is efficient: the same increasingly universal services work with millions of different goods. These services correspond to the most diverse expected roles of creators-providers in the most diverse creation graphs. A cast iron supplier typically merely supplies cast iron goods. However, when it comes to a service specializing in supply methods/services,
it easily provides something else besides cast iron. It can even become a "marketplace." When it comes to payments, one can pay for anything. When it comes to supporting cloud software, essentially, this software can be anything. Not only can different things be done with the same product::method, but the same doing::method is well applicable to different products.

A modern store (say, internet-aggregators of retailers, "marketplaces" --- they include today, Yandex.market, Wildberries, Megamarket, Ozon, Amazon, linked with delivery services and a network of order pickup points with fitting rooms) mainly provides not the purchased product itself, but offers the service (work method with some service/method object) of selling::service and delivering::service the product::object. The skill and toolset of the marketplace as the service provider "delivery against payment" with the object "delivery against payment." Here, one can easily confuse with the same name service and service object, since "delivery" and "payment" on one hand are gerunds (names of work methods with goods/product::"method object" and money::"method object"), on the other hand, a system in the physical world, where the product is delivered and transferred into the customer’s ownership, the payment's money is delivered to the product supplier's accounts and transferred into their ownership (thinking about non-cash money roughly the same way as about cash: with nuances, but it boils down to a pile of gold in the bank’s basement, so money is about the physical world, not descriptions).

It’s important to understand that the target system of the project of creating and developing the service provider and the service object is with the client. The provider's service changes something in the client’s systems (target or some creator in the creation graph, like a tool of some creation method) or even not the system, but the descriptions of the client’s system (sometimes through a long chain of "descriptions of descriptions"). For example, the service may modify the description of the target system, reflecting it in the project documentation. The service may change the content of its database with the description of the client’s target system --- and then this description might be used for physical changes in the embodiment of the target system (manufacturing or repair), and the whole idea of engaging the provider might be precisely for this ultimate physical change. All such chains of changes associated with service providers/services/servers stretching to the physical world must be traced and comprehended.

If you are instructed to "create a service" (usually this means "create a provider that will provide services, i.e., conduct instances of work by some work method"), you can make a serious mistake: considering the target system to be the provider itself: its tools and expertise. No, the target system is the system we change with the service/method (possibly by a chain of descriptions, if the service object is some description, not a system, and sometimes the object will be the expertise or toolset of creating the target system).

The service created in this case is the method::behavior of the new created provider (who works on someone else’s target system, effectively joining the team), and this provider is "our system." Moreover, you yourself are the creator for "our system," meaning you must also create yourself as the producer of work to create the provider, i.e., it’s about a chain of creation in a large creation graph of the target system. The target system remains the system everyone involved in the creation graph needs to agree on --- your project of creating a new provider makes sense only to the extent that someone needs to do something with their target system, and they invite "your system" (provider) to participate in the project.

You will then need to ensure that the created provider/service/server indeed creates the target product/system with the required quality level, and also you demonstrate sufficient speed and efficiency in creating the provider itself.

Why are creation graphs so complex? Here’s one of the creation chains in the creation graph of a hairstyle (not a hairdressing salon, as the target system in the hairdressing salon creation project is a hairstyle, the hairdressing salon here is one of "our systems," and there are other "our systems" in the creation graph):

- System-1: you, as the creator of the team creating the hairdressing salon. You
  organize a small engineering-management team and suppliers
  of goods (chairs, scissors, hairspray) and services (room repair) in a
  project that will create a hairdressing salon (and we don’t even consider
  the beginning of the chain: after all, you are "commissioned to create"
  a hairdressing salon, meaning you are not at the beginning, but you were created as a creator!)
- System-2: the engineering-management team and suppliers of goods and
  services creating the hairdressing salon (this team is organized
  by you)
- System-3: the hairdressing salon (people with hairdressing skills,
  premises with tools, managers), created by your
  engineering-management team
- System-4: the hairstyle, the target system of the entire project, created
  by the hairdressing salon in a case/project for each client
  of the hairdressing salon.

This chain needs to be clearly understood. Without a clear understanding
of who creates what system and who is responsible for what, you cannot understand the
project, and the risk of failure will be high.

So, in the project of creating a hairdressing salon::provider for performing
works of the hairdressing service, the target system (product) will be
the hairstyle of someone else’s hair, which changes its state from "was not"
to "become." Specific methods comprising all the complete work methods (service)
for cutting and styling hair include choosing the style, cutting hair, styling,
possibly mixing hair with spray and decorating with ribbons and flowers (if provided). This is the creation and development of a hairstyle (since these hairstyles will be made repeatedly, becoming better and better each time). The work of creating and developing the hairstyle
is the performance/work of the service/method of LLC "Chickchick" with all its
people-hairdressers and premises with the tools of hairdressers in their role
as a hairdressing salon.

A splendid hairdressing service (the hairdresser working on the client’s hair with golden scissors on a throne-like chair under a live orchestra) resulting in a poor hairstyle is not what is needed, clearly, it will not be a successful target system. In a service, the main thing is achieving the state of the target service object (object of the work method, i.e., the object of creating
the hairstyle --- achieving the target state of the hairstyle). A sports hairstyle instead of a date hairstyle is also not what is needed, right? When we engage in system creation to provide a service for creating the target system (developing server software, opening a service provider company), never forget the target system and its higher system.

It's very easy to forget why the creator-provider exists, why the service will be used -- and once that's forgotten, the target system ceases to be successful (and everything is done for it), happy clients suddenly become unhappy, and you lose them. If a manager thinks of the aircraft manufacturing plant as their target system, the plant may be super-duper advanced, people super-duper collaborating, work processes super-duper streamlined, but if the produced aircraft do not fly (the target system is a used, therefore, flying aircraft), then the plant producing such non-flying aircraft is not needed (moreover, it’s harmful: it burns through investors’ money).

If you think about the target system and the external project roles in its
creation and development, think in writing: document these thoughts and discuss them with
the team and these external project roles. And check against various checklists,
whether you’ve thought about all the important objects of the project, whether you’ve let things take their own course, whether you’ve made mistakes in your thinking, whether you’ve missed anything in your work.
