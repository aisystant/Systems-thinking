title: The target system depends on who is looking for it
---

It is common for top managers at some factory to admit that 50% of employees do not know what the enterprise produces — all they see are some parts of some time creation systems, but what there becomes tools for creating the target system and what the target system itself is, what characteristics of the target system are paid for, how their work is connected with this money, how the target system looks at the moment of operation — this is unknown. This is bad because it means that many people make suboptimal decisions: they literally do not know what needs to be done to make the target systems better. Should the detail weight be reduced, or the strength increased, or the price lowered, or the processing class made more accurate within the given budget — what is more important? It depends on where this part is planned to be used. And what if you don't know? The decision will be "any," and hundreds and thousands of decisions will be made "somehow." It is necessary to come to an agreement regarding the target system.

You are the manager of the creation system, you want to increase labor productivity, increase the speed of product release. If it is a service, the speed of product release must also be increased, but this product is "on a tolling basis" — you simply change the state of someone's foreign system material, not your own material. But this will be the target system: what you change with your project as a whole, with your skill and tools at the output of the large creation graph. The project is defined by the scale of collective agreements in your organization. So how to determine the speed of product release, you can't raise it without knowing what it is? It's the number of instances of the target systems that the creator system project manufactures (i.e., the number of instances at the output of the entire creation graph of the target system) in a small unit of time (speed is the first derivative of the number of products over time, and derivatives are defined in "deltas," ratios of small values. So we ensure it is not "systems per year," aim for the minimum unit of measurement — seconds, days, but not months and years, because you will know your results too late to change anything as an operational manager). If it is unknown what the "target system" (class/type of product/item) is — the speed of release is unknown. If the speed of release (throughput, but we are interested in the natural expression, not monetary expression) is unknown, it is impossible to say how some organizational change you started affects it. It is necessary to agree on what the target system is, all release calculations should then be conducted for it, not some other system. The first thing that should interest the manager is the target system, not the enterprise::creator::system. Because if you do not know what the creator should create, no decision about it will make sense. Should the number of welders be increased to speed up product release? The answer to this question will be clear only if we go through the systems mantra:

- What the target system does in the systems environment.
- What it needs to be made of to do that.
- Do welders are necessary there at all.
- And only here can we estimate whether to increase the number of welders by the critical chain method [^1] or some other operational management decision-making method.

This is a very subtle point: you need not to build the target system the way your organization can, but to make the organization (creator) such that it can release the target system. And the target system should be such that it will be successful. If you are a bad cook and will bake pies as you can (but organize the enterprise perfectly, will bake bad pies quickly and cheaply), then you will be doing this only until the investor's money runs out. You will have to deal with the target system:

- What pies should be to be needed by someone.
- What skills and tools you should have to produce good pies.
- And only after this can you deal with the enterprise, until then you need to deal with pies.

This is extremely important: target system first, creator enterprise afterward. A manager who declares their organization as the target system is mistaken, losing the ability to agree within the entire project. At a minimum, he may not agree with the clients, their opinion about his delightful enterprise will be negative since clients care about the target system and do not care about the enterprise. Therefore, it is better if the manager and the clients have the same target system. There are also engineering technicians (they will be called differently: gardeners, teachers, radio electronics designers), but it would be good for the manager to have a common goal with them too. The bakery manager's target system is buns, not the bakery! And the bakery? For the manager, it is the creator of the target, it will be created within the creation systems graph. But first, let's agree on whether it is buns or bulldozers. And we will agree with everyone that it is buns, not bulldozers.

The target system is defined subjectively, "the system in the eyes of the beholder," so determining "the system you want to make" starts with paying attention to who "you" are: how many of you are there, what are your interests. Systems thinking — this is thinking of collective/group activities, with its help large teams agree on projects with target systems with millions of individual details in each instance, with hundreds and thousands of enterprises in the graph of creating such huge systems. In labor division, setting a common target system for the project is important to maintain the attention of different agents in the most diverse roles on their common vital (target system!), so that without losing this attention to the systems as a whole, allow caring about subsystem details by individual members of each team.

What to do if you are the development director of a huge holding with hundreds of projects for creating and developing hundreds of different types of target systems, a vast range of products and services? First, you need to understand that you will not be able to figure out all these target systems at once. You will have to deal with each system individually, not overgeneralizing. Otherwise, you will have some "equipment" or "skills" — and it will be impossible to meaningfully discuss anything at this level of generality. First, you need to deal with each target system in each project, and only then look at their common creator system, from parts of which the creator organizations of each target system will be composed — and discuss how common their creation graphs are, how much projects of individual systems compete for resources. You will still need to start with target systems, without overgeneralizing: take projects one at a time. And if you wave it off and make "just a holding"? It will not work! If you do not know what exactly the holding is doing, what its strategy is (what methods we will teach the holding to work, which target systems will be successful if these methods are applied) — nothing will work out, except for wild confusion and squandering of resources on incomplete projects. Do not be lazy, you need to deal with individual target systems of individual projects, although even in this, you can involve labor division.

**There are no strict rules for determining the target system**, algorithm, order of thought steps, order of questioning some people, typology of cases (this is an entrepreneurial/creative/research task! There is no algorithm for entrepreneurship/creativity/research, only generation of guesses and their criticism!). One way or another, various agents in different roles will participate in the decision regarding the choice of the target system, trying to satisfy different interests by various working methods, and this concerns not only team members of the target system creators but also external roles. If you have a project you can manage alone, you will not need extensive systems thinking, fragments will be enough. But if the project is complex and works with a group, there will inevitably be a complex negotiation process, and you will have to agree on the target system as you progress.

**Usually, the target system cannot be determined while sitting in one's workplace and thinking: it is necessary not only to read different documents and know your subject area well but also to meet and talk with many people, sometimes conducting experiments, including implementing models, prototypes.** Sometimes they even say that until you leave your workspace and start communicating with various agents, systems thinking doesn't happen — you will not know anything about the target system, you will not know what everyone has agreed on, and whether they agreed at all.

Do not confuse:

- **"our system"** (MySystem, OurSystem, engineered system "my" personal, or "of our small team") and
- **the target system**, which is common for many teams, and the teams agree on it.

Without the target system, it is impossible to deal with "our system": for it, it must first be clear where it is located: in subsystems of a certain target level, in supersystems of the target, in systems of the creation graph. If we do not understand how our system contributes to the creation of the target system — our system will not be successful, you will not be able to explain why the creator team of your system has some questions for other teams creating other systems. And if there is a target system — whoever you talk to in the project, you are members of one team of creators!

Yes, if we make "our system" satisfying precisely our team interests (or even interests of the direct customer of our system — the external project role of our subproject of creating the target system) — we will be happy, our interests are considered, and even the customer's interests are considered, but the success of the entire project of creating the target system as a whole is primarily determined by success for the external roles of the target system project, not by success for the roles of our little team and even the external roles of our little team!

"Our system" will, of course, be done, and we will demand payment for our work. But the money is usually paid for the target system: there is no connection between our system and the target system — there will be no money for work; our system project can be scrapped immediately, and if we somehow managed to negotiate payment, they will find a way not to pay: if our system does not help create and develop the target system, then how can payment be made from the general project funds?

Similar reasoning will apply in cases where we are not talking about monetary payment, but pursuing other goals. For example, if you conduct a political project and perform a small part in it, investing your labor resources and expecting non-monetary results from the realization of our system and ultimately the target system.

**Every project is unique** **in its target system and its creation methods. Unique not only in the type of target system, but the systems in the creation graph are also unique, the methods of work of the creators and the degree of skill of creators in these methods are also unique.** Each situation in work with specific methods and types of systems is unique, so you will not remember and apply anything in the same form — you cannot enter the same river twice, you cannot make the same system in the same way twice.

**Even if you (as a team!) are doing something very similar a second time compare to the first time, you have** **experience, you know the risks better than you did the first time, you have more information —** ** and based on this experience you can make completely different decisions, organize work differently, avoid the mistakes made the first time.** **Creating a system** **might** **use some** **specific work methods, but system development may involve changing work methods.** Say, the first time you hammered nails with a microscope, but the second time you are unlikely to do that — you will consider the failed experience of the first time.

"Remember the method we used and always do it that way" — this is not about systems thinking; systems thinking draws attention to important thinking objects, but it does not cancel thinking itself, especially about systems in their environment, and then about the methods of work to create these systems. You will have to pull your head out of your pocket and think in every project, for every created increment of a system's functionality during its development: systems thinking helps to ask questions, but finding answers to them, talking with different people and making decisions after these discussions will still have to be done. Systems thinking gives types of objects for your thinking, but it does not think for you: what to do next with these objects — remains your applied skill and fundamental thinking skill (intellect, this question is: what to do when you don't know what to do — which method to use when the method is unknown).

And once again, we remind you that reflections on achieving collective agreements regarding the target system, "revealing the system" (like all other design considerations) are usually done "in classes/types," with system types, not with individual systems-specimens/individuals. Yes, you are working in a unique situation, but no matter how unique the projects and systems are, there is still an attempt to transfer as much knowledge from project to project as possible, accumulating knowledge, reusing knowledge, focusing on patterns rather than individuals. Even if you are doing something like the Eiffel Tower, you will still work with types, individuals will only appear during the manufacture and assembly of constructs of various systems levels of the target system.

All systems are in the eyes of many beholders, so you will need to:

- Form your ideas about the target system (come up with these ideas yourself, or speak to different people if you have recently joined a long-running project). You "reveal the target system" for yourself, but this does not mean that this target system has become the target system of the entire project. Therefore,
- Then you need to agree with the team and external project roles about the target system (and if you are the project organizer, not agree with them, but make them all agree with each other — and also with you), and about the supersystem with systems in the near and far environment. This will be considering the target system as a "black box," creating a usage concept.
- Only after that, discuss subsystems (the target system as a "transparent box," functional decomposition) and what to make them from (system concept — with which constructs-affordances you will implement subsystems).
- Discuss methods for creating the target system, i.e., methods of manufacture, assembly, testing, launch into operation of the target system, the general method of creating and developing (the system will need to be created not only as an MVP but also developed, released with many versions, possibly even releasing each version in small series or even setting up mass production).
- Only after the methods of creating the target system are known, it can be discussed what roles are needed to support these creation methods,
- and then discuss the different creation systems (including the team as one of the creation systems!) throughout the creation graph, taking into account the expertise of these creation systems in the necessary working methods, as well as the availability of tools for these methods
- and still remember about "our system" among all these project systems.

Of course, this we again presented the systemic thinking mantra in brief. You just need to reason in exactly this way in all projects, and this is the norm of systemic thinking: not just read that you need to do it this way, but take it — and do it. You don't just read that people usually brush their teeth and take a shower but also brush their teeth (even if you don't want to) and take a shower (even if you feel lazy). With systemic thinking, it is the same: you don't want to but need to. Sigh and think by the systemic mantra until you get used to doing it "automatically," all the time, in all projects, subprojects, conversations with friends about their projects, asking these questions when participating in conversations. This is systemic thinking!

Of course, each project participant (and there may be many interconnected projects, so participants of other projects too) has their opinion about the project's target system, different from others. And project participants may change this opinion about what is the project's target system — right during achieving the various agreements between them (agreements are specifically about this: about changing opinions, there was one opinion — agreed on something, it means someone changed their initial opinion).

What to do in such a situation when opinions differ?! **Continuously agree, check the conservation of agreements—** **and continue to agree throughout the entire project, not just at its beginning.** **And if you are an organizer —** **continuously agree with those around you too.**

You will quickly accept this when you understand that any of your agreements will be violated if their participants, at the moment of agreeing with you, have not yet agreed among themselves. Then they agree — and their agreement will be stronger than the agreements with you, and when you agree with them anew, they will again reach agreements — and your agreements with them will again not hold. Therefore, it is better for you to agree on your own — and achieve collective agreements, as they will be more stable.

**Systems are created collectively; they are agreed upon in these collectives.**
**Systems thinking helps determine what to agree on.**
**First of all —** **about what we are making: which system is the target, i.e., which system's success will be key for the project. No agreement** **on the target system —** **collectively** **we don't know what to do,** **each does something according to their understanding. There is no good** **in such a situation.**

It is easy not to recognize this situation when there are extra generalizations in speech and documents. If we are making "shoes," it does not mean we have agreed. I think it is women's sandals size 36, neighbors considered it to be men's winter boots — and designed laces for them. Yes, all of it is "shoes," but when these developed laces meet the already designed top of sandals, both teams will be surprised. And if the sole of the "shoe" was entrusted to a third team, it is only possible to guess what they will think of — felt boots? There is only one way: specialize the target system agreements to the maximum and ensure that the agreement result about the target system is known to all teams.

Why is it so difficult to define a system? Because in the culture, there may still be no understanding of the convenient system level at which the system is defined.

Say, you are trying to propose a new way of creating a wall from large blocks, but at the moment only buildings are built from bricks (and the concept of a "wall" does not exist, only bricks). We gave this example when talking about systems thinking, which helps fight complexity: there are no meaningful operations with bricks in the building, but the concept of "wall" may not yet be formed; therefore, it is not worked with! The idea to define a wall as a system and give its alternative construction may be very, very fresh!

One of the real cases: it was required to create a system for transporting aircraft from one of the airfields to the manufacturer for repair. To do this, somewhere the gate opening needed to be increased, somewhere to add mounts on the carriage, somewhere to build an additional ramp. But all these tasks were solved as separate projects, "as they arose," they did not have common funding (and the money was not allocated all at once, but for each project separately, and it was necessary each time to verbally explain why to spend this or that amount and perform this or that work; there was no overall list of works). There was no understanding that this all needs to be done to create a "target aircraft transport system," there was no name for
