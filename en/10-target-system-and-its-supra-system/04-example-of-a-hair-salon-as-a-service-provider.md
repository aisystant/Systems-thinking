title: Example of a Hair Salon as a Service Provider
---

Let's take a step towards specificity and consider an example slightly more complex than a carpenter with a hammer driving someone else's nail. A hair salon (role/provider, implemented by the LLC "ChickChick") provides hair cutting services. The word "service" indicates that the hair there will be external, belonging to others, brought directly on the head, "the client's material." The reasoning doesn't change — whether it's cutting one's own hair or someone else's hair, only the terminology changes. For one's own hair, they say "perform hair cutting::method," and for someone else's — "provide hair cutting service." In "provide hair cutting service," the word "service" is used as a type of "cutting," similar to how sometimes, for greater persuasiveness, people say "airplane system" instead of just "airplane." One could also say it shorter, without mentioning the type "service" — "perform a haircut," and it immediately becomes unimportant whether it's someone else's head or your own. The language of methods and roles is more universal than the language of services and servers.

Next, we will consider a small checklist of important objects in the service situation. We first give a type from a more abstract meta-meta model (e.g., "service"), and then specify this type of meta-model for the subject area of hair cutting (e.g., "cutting and styling" for the service subject "hair," a metaU-model from a hairdressing textbook, or even a metaS-model from this hair salon's situation, such as the regulations for haircutting and styling for this salon).

We attempt to show that the objects of discussion are defined by their meta-meta model types from our course, and then we find life objects matching these types/roles in the "work project," rather than randomly selecting objects from life and then trying to find types from the course for them.

Why is this checklist needed, why go through it in a project? To discuss the project in a structured manner, not missing anything important. In the case of a hair salon, it's easy, everyone knows this subject area. But in the case of new types of services, it is not so obvious and requires thought. The types of the meta-meta model help not to miss any important objects in discussions about the subject area, i.e., the meta-models. Discussions on the subject area (meta-models) then help not to miss important objects of the concrete real-life situation model in a specific work project, in physical space-time. Here's the checklist, and remember, this is just the beginning of thinking, further systems thinking covers many more concepts and makes you consider a much larger number of important objects:

-   **Target System:** hairstyle (role/functional object). Obtained from hair (in this case, the client's hair, directly on the client's head, which is important for service wording) by performing haircutting and styling methods. Another wording: the hairstyle is achieved by providing services/service for the client's hair. Another wording: the hair salon performs haircutting and styling services for the client's hair, resulting in a hairstyle.
-   **Service:** haircutting and styling hair (specifically the client's hair - the type "service" implies the subject of the service is someone else's hair). These are methods/functions/ways of the hair salon's work as the role of the agent-org unit.
-   **Service/Method Subject:** raw material/preform - hair, target system/product - hairstyle. You can discuss the change in the state of hair during creation ("uncut," "cut but unstyled," "cut and styled"/"combed") or the hairstyle as a whole ("formless," "haircut exists, washing head is important as a household hairstyle," "target hairstyle exists"/"cut hair styled"). It's good to agree. Emphasis on the hair gives details in the hair salon's work, emphasis on the hairstyle reduces issues of "all hair work done, but the hairstyle is bad." The trick is the hair salon cuts hair so that even without styling it looks like a hairstyle (and with styling, it should be irresistible). If the hairdresser lacks cutting skills, the haircut leaves the hair in a state that without styling, the hairstyle is unpresentable, "horrible." It’s also important to note that the **target system is usually physical, but if your service/method outputs a description, the subject will be a description, and the target system will differ.** For example, an online hairdressing service will have the hairstyle sketch as the subject and the actual hairstyle as the target system. In any case, method work (including service work) changes states of subjects in the method/service subject area, and we're interested in the final state of the service subject, the one for achieving which the works are conducted.
-   **Suprasystem** **in** **the** **environment** **of** **the** **target system:** immediate surroundings of the hairstyle as a role/functional object: "head for a date" (but not "head for eating," for example, or "head for sports." The definition of the object by purpose/function/target behavior). It's vital to take the system environment as close to the target system as possible: the client's head in a specific situation (suprasystem — date), not the entire client's body. Here "closer" means closer by system levels, but remember that system levels are directly related to proximity in space-time (since the relationship of composition, parts-whole,” which links systems of different system levels, works exactly over parts and wholes of space-time areas).
-   **Need** (client as an external org role, owner of the head with hair on it): "impress the partner on a date with the head's beauty" (the phrase describes the suprasystem for the project's target system haircut-styling. "Beautiful head" - the client's tool for his target system "impressed partner." The hairstyle is part/subsystem of the "beautiful head" tool::system, the other part will be - makeup::system (not to be confused with "makeup application"::method or even work on a method with the subject of this method "makeup"). The client wants to handle makeup application (creating a beautiful face to impress the partner on a date). We (the hair salon staff::service/role, "we" are discussing this project - always track the composition of the accidentally thrown "we" - who is it, how many are there, what are they doing?!) do not discuss whether the client wants to impress the partner not only with the beauty of the head but also with the overall beauty of the body draped in clothing.
-   **Usage Concept:** the scenario implies the partner transitions to the state "impressed" after showing off the head with the hairstyle on the date. There are also various other scenarios (rain and wind on the way to the date, sleep before the date, what happens to the hairstyle after a shower when styling disappears, etc.). We, of course, consider the broader environment — scenarios including the head with makeup, the entire body with its drapery, the surrounding situation, for example, an indoor or an open area with rain and wind. Our target system should work well in a wide variety of situations, and these situations must be considered — some situations can be learned from the client, but part of these situations are considered from method knowledge/theories; the client may not know they were protected from something, a need was met they weren't aware of, which will arise if they suddenly find themselves in some variant of the usage scenario. Of course, if considering more and more scenarios/usage situations in the usage concept leads to an increase in the system's cost or usability, it will be necessary to agree on this with the client.
-   **Architectural characteristic** of hairstyle survivability: styled hair must look stunning, and without styling (if had to take a shower on a date) reasonably acceptable.
-   **Target System Creator:** the system providing the service. Hair salon::provider/service/server/provider/role - that's the creator of the hairstyle::“target system”. The fact that there is a hairdresser inside the salon who creates the hairstyle using skill and tools is not important now, we treat it as a black box and do not consider the internal division of labor in the hair salon; robots could be working there, too. The creator::role - this is normal, it’s just a functional review of the creator (and not constructive, the org unit here is LLC "ChickChick"). Service (hair cutting and styling) is not the hair salon itself or even its work. Service (hair cutting and styling) is the work method, there will be many instances of works for instances of hair by this method. Service is the behavior of the hair salon, described as the content/method of works, not the hair salon itself.
-   **User of the target system:** "hair salon client"/"combed person" (there seem to be no special names like "player" or "steelworker," so we take general meta-meta model types "client" or "person" and add subject-specific words role "hair salon" or indicate objectness in subject-specific action — "combed").

The service here is "haircutting and styling" (considered as two separate services, "haircutting" and "styling"), note the **gerund form** (in English it's "-ing" form of the word"), this is typical for functions/methods.

Difficult? Yes, for the first time it is complex. It gets easier with time. More and more service situations will fit this "hair salon" pattern (the example was chosen to definitely be a "service/provider," not "commodity production" — and it was roughly clear what we're talking about. But the brain then uses this example, reasoning within the prototype theory of concepts — "all services are somewhat similar to a hair salon").

Why so complicated, why not reason about a hair salon without mentioning all these meta-meta model types from our course? So that in discussing services (and just any work methods) in various situations, attention is drawn not to random objects but to the main/important objects of the situation. Think of it as a fragment of a checklist of objects to discuss to organize a group of people (creators of the hair salon, hair salon staff, clients) for collaborative work.

Of course, there are many more types of the meta-meta model indicating things of primary importance for their collective understanding in a project — our course also has many more types. This checklist is given here only as an example of systemic reasoning. But in life, there is fuss, haste, emergencies, sleeplessness, and clouded mind from simple exhaustion. Important objects derived from concepts of the intellectual stack as a whole (and systems thinking in particular) help keep scattered attention on what’s important.

For example, this checklist includes the needs/interests/preferences of the project’s external roles — why the client wants to turn to the service. What makes the external roles happy, not the internal team roles' happiness (which certainly also have interests and preferences, though they are rarely called "needs"). If there is a hairstyle, but the head ends up not in order after the hairstyle (for example, not only the hair but also the ears are cut off during the haircut), that's bad. If the hairstyle is for sports instead of a date — it’s a disaster. We always discuss/describe the target system (hairstyle, just an example) and the suprasystem (head, just an example) in pairs. Describing the suprasystem — needs of external project roles, describing the target system — usage concept. **Usage concept** **traces/describes** **the system's functionality description** **to the needs/interests** **of external project roles.** **Whether you like it or not, you need a** **usage concept.**

The chosen client service of the hair salon will be "cutting" or "styling" or both together. Choosing a method — it is strategizing, to achieve the result "impressed partner," the client chooses the method/service "hairstyle creation" and seeks works by this method from the service provider, the hair salon role organization. The hair salon has mastery of work execution by method (its staff’s skills — human or robots) and tools (mirrors, chairs, scissors, and clippers, combs, shampoos, and lacquers — all necessary for "providing the service," i.e., performing work by sets of hairstyle creation methods, that is cutting and styling methods).

The work of the service provider (service work, role work, and method work) takes definite time, uses specific equipment and resources, and changes particular hair on a specific head. And if speaking about the functional aspect "how it’s usually done, described in textbooks," a service is — a method/practice/culture of work, not the actual work. It could be "washing head and styling by a friend," "covering head with a hat at home to hide hair," etc. **Service is chosen** **during strategizing,** **it's executed as a strategy, for it planning is done —** **concrete resource use actions.** Planning occurs after method selection, that is, after choosing the method to achieve the result — impress the partner, including the client’s choice to conduct the work independently or purchase it from a provider (buying services). Lacking methods to achieve the result (didn't strategize — methods to choose methods) means you didn't think thoroughly (more on this in engineering and systems management courses). But to choose, distinguish:

Working towards a result — can be done with different methods, ways, using various resources. Rationality is the method of intellectual stack thinking. Rationality defines the way/method to generate alternatives and then use decision theory where you choose the best from alternatives and act accordingly. In economics, talking about opportunity costs means exactly this: you can achieve results with various methods/ways, these ways compete, but eventually, one is chosen (most resource-efficient), and this method/way usage is the work. Work with different resources can be done repeatedly by the same method. You can drive a nail with a hammer, stone, or microscope, but before that, you decide — drive the nail or screw the screw or glue it.

-   Method/way/culture of work execution. Multiple works can be done by one method, meaning numerous resources used to gain results (changing the state of the method's subjects) by the chosen method. If you hammer nails by a microscope, multiple nails can be driven by this method.

The head (target suprasystem) and hair on the head (subsystem) belong to the client; the hair salon — the creator, realized by an organization with its mastery and tools (including premises, but mobile service is possible). Hair salon — creator role performing works by a typical set of methods with client hair: changes hair state creating hairstyle, can also add its materials as hairstyle parts (ribbons, extensions, lacquer, etc.).

What is the target system? Hairstyle! If we organize our hair salon? Still — target system hairstyle, and the hair salon then is "our system"! We perform full systemic thinking with our hair salon, but it is in another system break, unlike hairstyle — hair salon refers to the creation system break seen during the hairstyle creation time/realm. Hairstyle's surroundings handled during use/operation/working time, and hair salon surroundings — during salon work (not creation!). Relation between hair salon::system and hairstyle::system — creation::relation. This relation builds the creation graph, but no "system levels" by it; hierarchy of system levels constructs by composition, applied at use. A hair salon as a system can be implemented differently: "private hairdresser" working at client’s home (clients love night-time appointments which can’t be done with other types — visiting a salon itself), as a department of a large holding, as a family business in a private apartment room. Hair salon (here service/provider) could be part of a salon holding, city block, having parts like salon chair, mirror, scissors. Discussing what happens during haircutting and styling methods execution — identical across all salon organization types. It is an economy of thought: the situation might change, thinking ways remain stable, and some thinking results stay, common for many situations.

We create not only target systems but creating systems for target systems too — hence talking about creation graphs, not just separate creation systems. Hair won't cut and style themselves, they're not alive (only a butterfly creates itself from a chrysalis, chrysalis from a caterpillar, caterpillar — from eggs). For service haircutting and styling, we create a hair salon with skills and tools, and for this, create a salon creator (like a construction company specializing in salons. But it doesn’t cut hair itself, as clients don’t, hence touching the division of labor, agent specialization on various work methods, on services).

If needed to do with rockets instead of client hair, we’d make a rocket design bureau and factory, not a hair salon. If it was about skill, opening a school, or university, or courses. First understand what to do (target system in its surroundings), then how (methods/services), then which creator-agent can skillfully and tool-wise execute works by the method/service. Many work providers for each service, they compete. We also create these creators if not existing yet (sometimes creating a creator chain). We teach skill to intellectual agents (considering labor division), supply tools (capital), and organize (make known who can delegate what, who will do what).

With hair salon creation, selecting service provision methods and salon arrangement depends on the method variant underlying the service, tracked to our system's suprasystem needs (e.g., owners' needs) and hair owners' needs (the target system's owners’ needs getting haircuts).

Description is for both hairstyle (target system) and hair salon (our system). System embodiment applies both to salon (our) and hairstyle (target). External project roles with their interests and preferences cover both project to create a hair salon and hairstyle creation — roles differ, interests differ (even with same interests!), can’t forget anyone, linked to hairstyle and salon success.

But the target system remains — hairstyle, for otherwise, losing sight of creating the hairstyle (instead of "our" hair salon, just a service provider), the hair salon works well but shortly, collapsing investor money as all client/product orientation lost.

Usually paid for creators’ work results — service provision, not creator creation. Paid for target system after creators (service providers) changed it to a new state, improving something, satisfying needs, easing concerns, meeting interests. If hair salon service (haircut-styling), paid for work giving a hairstyle used on groomed head. For hairstyle sketches and hairdresser talk on choosing model they might pay, only if final hairstyle usable. If not, customers will return to protest hairstyle, sketch, hairdresser talks: it’s service's internal matter to resolve why service behavior and results failed. Target system remains hairstyles; from their class, styling service priced 100 rubles, 1000 rubles, or even 10 thousand.

Interestingly, any engineer understands this reasoning on salons, consumer goods delivery services, but when his target system (e.g., industrial pipeline design) hits a project step, he seeks unconditional payment independently of final target system usability. Same as a hair salon: wants pay for a pipeline sketch regardless of its realization or not. Worse never seen their working target system "in metal," neither at a plant, nor with a client. No, target system here is working the industrial pipeline, if bad, not paid, and designer doesn't get due share. All businesses on earth are "generalized hair salons," all practical business and engineering reasoning akin, at
