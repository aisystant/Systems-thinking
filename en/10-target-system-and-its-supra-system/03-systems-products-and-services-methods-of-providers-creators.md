title: Systems-products and services/methods of providers/creators
---

The target system was often thought of as a delivered good (some
item manufactured for sale):
**product/item**::system::“physical object”, in different industries it
may have different names, for example, in construction --- a building or
structure, which are not usually called products or items, but in essence, are the same.**

The product/item is usually made by its creator from raw materials purchased
by this team and then physically delivered to its end
consumer for use, conditionally “crossing the enterprise border”,
changing ownership. And already in the consumer's ownership, this
product/item performs its role/function, operating within
the top-level system during exploitation. After the ownership transition, the consumer
of the product/item::system uses it in two ways:

-   as part of their own target system as a construct-affordance
    (for example, your client installs your watch-product in their
    car-product and then sells the car as a product to their client, and the watch shows the time during the use
    of the car)
-   as part of systems in the creation of their product (for example, your
    client installs your watch-product in their factory on the wall, so that workers
    can keep track of time while assembling a car as their
    product, and then sells the car to their client without your
    watch or with some other, not your watch. Your watch ends up being used as part of the factory,
    a system in the creation of the car).

An alternative option is to consider the target system immediately
to be a product not for you, but for the client who came to you with their raw materials ---
unfinished product, their target system, **subject
of service/method**. Your work is not with your raw materials and there is no
transfer of your product to the customer, you as the creator of the client's product
only work by the method-service, using your craftsmanship and
your tools of this method (service, maintenance) work.
The work goes on the client's raw materials and the product remains with
the client, in their ownership. You only change the state
of some systems that do not belong to you at that moment and will later
become part of either the client's product, or part of the client's toolset
(but here you need to be careful: if you worked on training
the client's employees, then the reasoning remains, only it is hard to consider the mastery
of employees as a tool, and even as “raw material” they very
conditionally belong to your client). In principle, the reasoning here is a bit
more complex, since services and methods of work, of course, are tracked down the chain to a system, but in real life, you may encounter some work with information (description of the system ---
design of the “iron” system, processing exploitation data, etc.). Most
reasoning about methods and services also works here, it is not necessarily the modification of systems, but it is mandatory that all these
changes to very different objects are somehow tracked through the (possibly very long) chain of changes to the target system. And if it is impossible to track, then it raises doubts about the usefulness of these works, maybe they do not need to be done at all, nothing will improve. Control question: “and if these method/service works are not done, what will happen to the target system?”.
If it is work with the creator, then further along the chain: “and then this
creator, what will he do better for the target system?” If the reasoning does not extend to the target system through some chain of cause-and-effect, then it's bad: it looks like you have encountered a disguise of useless work (although, of course, for the agent who will be paid for work unnecessary for the creation of the target system, this work is very necessary --- they want money for it, or they want to train their skills, or they want something local “for themselves”, but not global --- for the entire target system creation project).

Even with all the nuances, the situation of performing service works boils down to
there being no product/item in your project, but you simply take part in the creation graph of some target system with your work according to some method. The method by which you change the state of other systems (another’s target system, other constructs that will then make up someone else's target system, or even another’s toolset in the creation graph) is called **service/service/service.**

Here, you will only have works/behavior/changes according to your method (that is, works of your craftsmanship and tools according to the
knowledge/theories/algorithms of the method) as a creator over a non-belonging target system, changing its state. Here you will only be a creation system, your team will provide the client only external behavior --- service works.

In the literature (including English-language, the same situation as in
the Russian language) many different opinions can be found on what 
“service”^[<https://yadi.sk/d/4hIEcpcn3Ny9iN>] is,
the main ones are:

-   Service/provider, the role of an agent performing work on the subject
    of the method --- for example, an auto service as a provider of car repair methods, microservice --- software as a provider of data processing methods (rare use of “service” for inanimate systems).
-   Service/work by method on someone's subjects, for example “received 
    service for the client's car” (works of an unspecified service method for the car::client's subject performed).
-   Service/method of performing work on someone's subjects, for example,
    “performed the client's car service” (performed an unspecified method of work, i.e. work by method for the client’s car).

In Russian, “служба” is used to describe both service::process (method,
a pattern of action unfolding over time, externally observed
behavior) “provision of service”::work (words
providing/conducting/executing indicate that the method still needs to
be implemented by work), and the system that causes this behavior,
i.e. server/servant/provider. And this is sometimes a functional “servant” (role),
and sometimes constructive (agent). Occasionally, “service” is also called
the interface between the “servant” and the external world modified by this servant.

In our course, we adhere to the view that service is a method
of performing work (we distinguish service as a method of work, general for all
works of some server/role and service/method work), and the role performing
the method/service is called server/“service
provider”/server/служба/provider. Thus, there is synonymy with
role/provider/служба, but there are same problems as with role/stakeholder
(organizational role::“functional object”, or
org element in the role::“constructive object”, an example being --- “either 
Prince Hamlet, or Vasya Pupkin”).

We still adhere to the opinion that a provider is an organizational role (server
is more often used when talking about someone's agent tools, although in Russian, s
erver is often translated as “служба”, and then it can also be an org role, not an instrument role).

In projects, a provider is usually a conditionally external project role.
Conditionally external --- external because it works “someone else's on our material”,
and formally --- internal/team since in our creation chain,
it works as part of a common extended team (consisting of many
separate teams in a large creation graph) on the common target system.
If the provider is spoken of as a role, any org element can be appointed as a 
service-provider of some service/method in the course of org design.

Thus, service replenishes the synonym row
method/way/practice/strategy/culture/style/service, and is used mainly when talking about creation works 
on someone else’s material. Service is a method for creation works of various kinds, for example, measurement/description, changes in the physical world, prediction/design), performed on
something external, “someone else’s”, “on contract raw material”. If we speak
of the service “nail hammering”, then it is about taking an org element, 
playing the role of a provider/службы and making it perform the work of its method/service (work
of driving::method/service) for our nail. If we ourselves will drive
the nail, then everything is the same, just the terminology of the service and provider/службы won't be used.

The constructive object (org element) as a functional object
(служба/provider/role) performs the work of the service/method on the object
of the method. Our carpenter hammers our nail: “nail hammering”::“method
work to change nail state”, carpenter::role. Another’s carpenter
hammers our nail or our carpenter hammers another’s nail: “nail hammering”::“service/method to change nail state”,
carpenter::provider/role. Everything is the same, just different words and in the words ---
reference to “externity” (while there can be a long discussion about what is
“ours” and what is “not ours”, this needs to be agreed upon collectively).
Property in economics is determined not by what you consider yours,
but by what those around you consider yours, with which they agree).

For inanimate creators (toolset: machines, measuring
tools/instruments, tools/tools, gadgets, equipment and apparatus) it’s all the same:
the hammer just won't be called a service provider (but the owner of
the hammer might be), but a server (even “service server” will sound like “double butter”: “worker’s works”,
“service’s service”). Hammer::server/tool::creator in the role
“hammerer” performs the service “hammering”::method::behavior over the object “nail” changing its state.

We do not really distinguish in considerations about systems in creation graphs (if
it is not about project roles played by agents developing their
strategies to achieve their goal --- the hammer cannot play a work/project role! The hammer is not an actor, it is not hired!)
living and non-living systems, server/службы/provider/servant/server can be both an enterprise, a person, and just some tool,
the difference here is more terminological. Their method of work as a creator in
changing something not their own --- service.

We have already encountered a situation where systems were classified on 
their belonging to certain owners, these are systems of systems (SoS).
The same with services: it is simply about the work of some
creators, only not on their product or their
creator in the creation graph of their product (for example,
toolset for implementing some method), but on someone else’s product
or someone else’s creator, for example, someone else’s toolset. If you came
to sharpen someone’s knives in their kitchen, and these are not your knives and not your
kitchen --- then this means you came to “provide a service”, “perform
service works”/“perform works by method”.

Service “nail hammering” may turn out to be a function/method/means within
a larger method, working on a larger situation:
fastening boards, preparing a mount for a picture on the wall, eliminating
a scratching nail, etc.

So do not be surprised when you hear two completely different
conversations using different terms about the same object, the same
product and its same behavior: this is the specificity of interests.
Service is usually about the behavior of the creator, the method of their work on “someone else’s”
object, which should change its state during the service work.
Service is the method (to hammer a nail), and the works are the
activation/provision of the service (to hammer ten nails --- these are ten
works according to the method “to hammer a nail”). As with the method, we distinguish
provision of service (execution of the method) and the service itself (method). Everyday 
expressions like “provide a service” actually mean “provide a server that will perform the service work” (that is, provide an org element or tool,
that will do the work, being in the role of the executor
work by method).

An attentive student has already noticed that here we are simply training
their neural network with ten repetitions in slightly different words of the same
thing: an agent, being in a role, performs work by method, changing the state
of objects of this method. The only difference is the ownership of objects
changing state during the work by the method: for different
ownership (ours or someone else's) the terminology differs markedly,
all words are different, but the essence remains the same. In the case of “someone else's”
the target system for the provider is the very object of their service.
For the carpenter and even the hammer, looking for a target system is necessary where
the nails are, even if they are not theirs, but given for hammering! If you
were called to paint someone’s fence and even provided with paint, then
you can further choose --- the target system is the layer of paint in the right places,
or the fence as a whole, transferred from the “ugly” state to a “beautiful” state
by method/service “painting” (another variant of methods/services ---
“rebuilding”, “drapery” and even “elimination”, because no fence --- no
problem of its beauty).

In this lies the power of systems thinking, the power of the meta-meta-model: reasoning
with objects of attention is carried out “conceptually” at a level of abstraction higher
than the level of storytelling about subject areas.
