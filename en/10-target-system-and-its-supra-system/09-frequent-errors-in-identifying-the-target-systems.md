title: Frequent mistakes in identifying the target system
---

There are not many signs of a target system, but agents (humans, AI, and even entire organizations) still make errors in identifying the target systems of their projects. The issue is that **systems thinking doesn't indicate what is the right choice** **of the target system** **and doesn't indicate what will be in the environment of the target system.** **However,** **the advantage of systems thinking** **is that systems thinking** **emphasizes that it is the most important object in the project —** **and** **forces you to choose, it doesn't let you avoid this choice!** How to understand this? Much like when you enter a huge grocery store with the understanding that you need to buy "food": the store has thousands upon thousands of products that all fall under the concept of "food" — but what specific food do you need at this moment in time? The type "food" — everything that can be eaten. But what exactly do you need right now? Three jars of mustard? Or a sweet bun? Smoked mackerel? Groats packaged in a 1kg bag, and then you eat it even without boiling, crush it into flour — and eat it raw? If you do not proceed to describe specific types of products and do not understand what to do with the purchased specific products afterward (for each product — something to do by different methods! Bite and chew something, subject something to "culinary processing" of various kinds, drink something), the task of buying "food" will not be solved. You need to decide what exactly to buy, the general type "food" will not suffice. But it definitely won't be a stool, not a car, not a fence, because none of these are of the type "food."

With systems thinking, it's about the same: for the type of meta-meta-model "target system," you need to find the type of meta-model for the system, which should be much more specific than just "target system," already belonging to a subject area. But these shouldn't be objects of the non-"target system" type.

We have already written about many errors in identifying systems that you want to declare belonging to the type "the target system of my project for the creation and development of this target system," but let's repeat again to have a small checklist handy of why university students fail "Systems Thinking" (and if they fail three times, they get expelled as unprepared to study), and entire teams in working projects go for project retakes, including very large teams:

-   **You mistake the description of the system for the system.** Programmers consider that their system is the source code, not the program in the moment of execution (when all the program variables hold the program state!), and certainly not the enterprise service (organizational unit: project team), which delivers the result required from the program, and without this service, the program cannot deliver this result. But the source code is a description; it is information, not a physical object that can store the state of the world at the moment of its use and change the world state around. Designers and engineers consider it to be design and engineering documentation (whether electronic or paper). The same: "documentation" is an information carrier, and the information itself is not a system. A screenwriter thinks it is the script of a play or film, rather than the play or film during the viewers' viewing. A choreographer thinks it is his carefully thought out set of movements he shows to dancers (the choreographer himself, demonstrating this set of movements, is the "description document"; choreographers rarely make recordings in some notation), rather than the performance/"dance composition," which the artists-dancers will later perform, even if the performance is also a target system, but its description is considered more important. A data modeler thinks his target system is the data model, not the data structured according to the model (for example, a database built according to the data model/schema), and even the final step is not made: usually, the target system is described by this data, it is not the data itself! All of these, unfortunately, are more than typical mistakes. The thought of the target system needs to be brought to the moment of changing reality during the exploitation of the system, to implementations, not to descriptions of changing reality! To describe is not to do, not to change the world! And it's not enough even to use "design for manufacturing" (although this is also necessary and important). Design should primarily be concerned with exploitation, manufacturing here is only an intermediate stage. Describing something convenient for manufacturing is not the physical something that brings benefit at the moment of exploitation! You cannot consider that "another person, organization, tool deals with the embodiment, and I prepare the description." No, you prepare the description only so that it is later embodied. This embodied object will be your system or target system, even if you don't personally make it with your own hands. You participate in a collective project to make a system. And this system is your (and everyone else's) target system. Descriptions are not the system. But if you work with some method of creating descriptions, then this description can quite be the subject of the method. Some method subjects are systems, but not all. Some of these method subjects can quite be descriptions, and work methods are used for the most diverse objects.
-   **Creator/"Creation system"/tool/"Service Provider" as the target system.** This is a typical manager's mistake: to consider the organization creating the target system as the target system itself (and also add "this is my target system" — an added confusion between "our/my system" and the "target system of the whole project"). The mistake leads to the organization's prosperity for a short period until the investor's money runs out. If such a manager is tasked with building an aircraft factory, he will build an aircraft factory that will work excellently and all the workers there will be fed and cared for — but the aircraft of this factory will not fly, because the factory will be built as the target system, the focus of the whole project and its participants will be precisely the factory. The planes produced by the factory will not be at the center of this manager's attention, and the manager will not allocate enough resources for the production of quality planes, he will be concerned with the quality of the factory life, and the planes for him will just be "production output numbers." A typical result of such an approach is that the manager allocates more money for computers for the financial service than for the engineering calculations of the target system. To be fair, engineers often make the opposite mistake: they overlook creation systems without which the target system is impossible (that is, they have first-generation systems thinking, not yet reaching in their thinking the importance of discussing the creators and their methods of work), but more on this in our course later.
-   **Identical names of the target system and its part** (or the target system and the super-system), you probably need to specify one of the names used, calling the incomplete system differently (say, "the house consists of the box/building part of the house, communications, finishing" can be said, but "the house consists of the house, communications, and finishing" cannot. "The cell consists of the body and the gasket" can be said, but "the cell consists of the cell and the gasket" — cannot).
-   **Identical names for very different systems.** Remember that a "business trip" can be 1. Work done remotely, including a business trip to the place of work. 2. The business trip as everything that happens during this trip. 3. The formal part of the business trip as only that part of the trip that can be accounted for (say, train travel can be accounted for, but taking a taxi cannot, in the formal part of the business trip this taxi ride will not exist, whereas in the business trip as a whole — it will). Someone considers "we sell smartphones" as "we sell a smartphone with a power block", while someone — "we sell a smartphone without a power block". The term "smartphone" here will denote different systems (with a power block and without) with different prices, different weights, different behavior during charging.
-   **Too high system level** (reference "to the village to grandfather Konstantin Makarich"): ignoring the closest super-system when determining the target system. The tail of a herd, a brick in a house, the target system "light bulb" suddenly works not in a room, but in a "smart home". Masked by the words "used everywhere" (a reference to any super-systems), or completely indefinite addresses. "— Where is your drilling machine used? — In mechanical engineering!" "— What dances will you accept for staging? — Any!" If you see names of industries, ministries, countries (these are huge super-systems, too large!) as super-systems — beware of such super-systems. Beware of words with universal quantifiers and loss of specificity of the subject area ("any", "every", "all", "universal", "multi-purpose", etc.). "Made in China", "used in Serbia" — these are very bad references.
-   **Overgeneralization** (pointing to some superclass instead of a specific class of systems). The mistake is to say and write "equipment" instead of "washing machine" or "transformer substation", food instead of mustard and fried chicken. If you understand that you have blurted out (yes, not "said", but "blurted out") a term from a textbook that applies both to the system from your project and to thousands of other systems that are nothing like the system from your project — it’s a mistake. "My target system is equipment" — for such a general phrase, one should be fired immediately, this is the pure truth, but useless truth, a demonstration of the inability to think. Do not talk about meta-meta-model relationships, this is already covered in our courses (for example, the course "Systems Thinking"). Talk about the relationships of objects of your project, your subject area! If terms from your subject area do not appear in your speech and documents — you simply do not think, you do not master the operation of typing.
-   **Relativism** (the mistake of those who are unsure of belonging to some team). That means anything is defined as a "target system," ignoring the presence of one's own team, one's own organizational unit, which may have some "our system," not a target one. Systems thinking in this case ceases to serve the purposes of coordinating collective/group activities. If you agree that "any system in our project can be target" — this is a poor understanding of recursive system consideration (you can conduct system reasoning about any system). If you have a project to create a target system, then specify for what target system (and this should be an indication of a functioning target system, its usage time) all other systems in the project are united! Yes, the target system is also a system, but all other systems in the project are gathered in the project precisely for its creation and development. And it's necessary to agree for which specific system everything is gathered; you cannot just agree that "all systems are important, let's work on all of them." No, you need to work not on everything, but on what leads to the success of the target system — the one for the project.
-   **The target system as all kinds of systems of all kinds of projects managed by the agent (most often a large enterprise with many types of products).** This is a very common mistake of a top manager who got many projects. This is very similar to the overgeneralization situation. If you received a project for the manufacture of a home electric meat grinder (one target system) and New Year's fireworks (another target system) simply because some owner bought two companies, or for some other reasons, do not try to depict them as a target system. Leave them as two different target systems! Do not fall into the overgeneralization mistake, because it will end with you calling the so-called target system "equipment" — and then everything will be bad, because what is good from the options of working methods for meat grinders will not be good for fireworks and vice versa, with few exceptions. Separate from your all-encompassing creation graph its parts for projects creating different systems, honestly name these systems as separate — and then discuss whether it is advantageous (to whom exactly it is advantageous) to have a large common part of the creation graph for different target systems, or it is not very advantageous and better to get rid of some projects, because it is easy to fall into the situation jack of all trades, master of none ("engaged in everything, master of nothing"). First, you need to determine which system you are making, and then soberly assess if you can make this system — or you were simply taken "on weakness" and given an obviously losing deal, and you took it.
-   **Ignoring the primacy of the main** **function/method of the system's operation.** That is, the system is identified not by its main action in the environment (function/method::behavior, by which it changes the objects of its environment as part of the super-system during exploitation), but by some other considerations. For example, you are trying to say that some group of assets::"physical items" belonging to one owner is your target system. There seems to be a part-whole relationship, an "asset in the group of assets", but there are no interactions in such a group and interactions with the system environment, no new properties emerge from combining assets into a group, i.e., not a system, no system effect. For example, an "enterprise information system" is very often defined precisely through the ownership relationship to the enterprise, and this is a mistake. To say that the "enterprise information system informs" is to say nothing about its role/function/purpose in the super-system (most likely, this super-system will be the enterprise as a whole!). This is too general a characteristic. The example with the dog is usually well understood in compliance with this principle: you need to say "guard dog," not "Vasiliy’s pet" (ownership relationship) or "yard animal" (overgeneralization and lack of a role in the super-system). 
-   **Missed system.** The department of working with disabled people designs a learning program for them, this learning program is transferred to the university’s academic part, the academic part of the university sends teachers to teach disabled people according to the special program (because they often cannot follow the general program). The target system here seems to be the trained functional part of the disabled person’s brain (let’s call it "skill"), which will be activated in situations for which the disabled person is being trained. But who trains the disabled person, what system creates his skill? A team of teachers sent by the academic part! This organizational unit is the provider of training as a skill creation service ("tool", instruments of the academic part/dean's office, but one can consider the academic part/dean's office as the organizer/creator for this teaching organizational unit, this is already not so important). Guessing that a group of teachers is practically indistinguishable from a team of programmers programming some application is very hard, because separately sent by the academic part teachers from the general pool of university teachers are not perceived as an organizational unit. And for good reason: you missed the existence of an important subject of discussion, missed the system. It's not the target (the target is skill), but without discussing it, you won't get a normal creation graph.
-   **Fleets, pools, agencies, client bases.** Often they miss some “fleet”::"active transport means — electric locomotives, tractors" or "pool"::"passive systems — wagons, carts" as a separate system with many other systems as its parts. Even an agency as some multitude of agents and "client base" as a multitude of all clients. Interaction of such a system's parts here isn’t obvious, but it’s cunningly arranged — through joint processing, joint description, joint competition for resources, joint creation (common creation graph). Moreover, there are emergent characteristics (for example, for the client base, its growth is important, this characteristic is not present in individual clients, but the total number of clients characterizes the client base as a whole, and one might be interested in the growth of the client base, the growth rate of the client base, the client base growth acceleration). This is a very controversial question, whether to consider such "collective systems" like client base full-fledged systems of systems approach, but modern systems thinking is getting closer to the so-called "constructive" definition of the system — and the system is defined not just as existing in the world of objects and relations, but as a result of operations for building such a system from parts, and the description of the system is a result of operations for building descriptions by the creator-agent. And if there are new properties at each system level — it’s OK, and the interaction of systems with each other is considered indirectly — through the creator-agent conducting some creation operations. Kit Fine^[Kit Fine, Towards a Theory of Part, 2010, <https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/philosophy/documents/faculty-documents/fine/accessible_fine/Fine_Theory-Part.pdf>, Kit Fine, The Identity of Social Groups, 2020 <https://metaphysicsjournal.com/articles/10.5334/met.45/>] pushes this line of "constructivism" in mereology (the study of parts and wholes). We will tell about this approach as a modern trend in systems approach in the last section of our course.
-   **Pointing to a system associated with the target one, instead of the target one itself.** For example, you say "Uralnatria’s order" instead of pointing to the system. It then turns out that Uralnatria has many orders, they change, but the system has already been made and resold to Siberpotash in a completely different configuration. It would be good to understand that "order" is not a system, but it can be an indication of an agreement between the supplier and the customer about a deal. But the system itself is not an "order." Usually, this is a manifestation of metonymy: the clumsiness of people when they call another object instead of the one they try to name, related by often rather uncertain relations to the object they are trying to name. If you identified the system “Uralkalin’s order,” how many people will understand that you mean the state of your company and Uralkalin, who entered into a deal to make something unknown (the word "order" can imply an order for anything — pigs, clock towers, tunneling machines for salt mines, training a couple of thousand employees in Chinese — order/deal/agreement), and how many people will understand that this is the named target system — say, the same tunneling machine, which will be the target system, and which is mentioned in the "order", and in the order there will also be money, and deadlines, and much more, but the target system itself is exactly this tunneling machine for salty mines.

... many other mistakes manifesting in many other situations. We repeat that systems thinking simply defines your objects of attention, but it is not step-by-step/algorithmic, it does not provide a clear formula for obtaining results. You have to guess, make a hypothesis about what your target system is, and the set of concepts of the system approach will provide
