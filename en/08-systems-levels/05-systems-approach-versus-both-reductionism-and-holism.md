title: Systems approach against both reductionism and holism.
---

The Systems approach (approach --- this is the transfer of the concept of “system” developed in
physics to other areas, primarily biology) emerged precisely to combat **reductionism** ---
attempts to describe complex objects without distinguishing systemic levels and
associated systemic effects (emergencies). Since
reductionists do not distinguish separate systemic levels, they highlight the leading
method/function and its discipline/theory/explanation of some lower
systemic level (parts of the system, sometimes several levels below
the level of the entire system being considered) as a means to explain
the behavior of the whole system. Thus, the behavior of a person may be explained by reductionists
through chemical and electrical processes occurring in the brain between the primary brain cells, neurons. Is it correct?
Yes, it is, mathematically absolutely correct! But completely
useless! Remember the “tail of the herd”: it is difficult to understand what operations
can be performed with subsystems several levels below while discussing
the properties of the current level. Although, of course, one can somehow
trace how certain properties of the system follow from
the properties of its subsystems, it becomes increasingly difficult to track these properties
with every level of subsystem increase. For example, it’s still possible to trace that
“brick houses are usually warmer than panel houses” if we notice that reinforced concrete
panels are strong and therefore thin, while bricks require many layers making the walls thicker. But stretching this further across many systemic levels to materials --- fired clay, concrete, and rebar makes the explanation convoluted. Without “panels” and “bricks,” without “walls” (systems of intermediate systemic levels), explanations won't work.

The behavior of the current level in systemic thinking is explained by
the interaction of systems of many systemic levels up and down from
the current one, which does not eliminate the thesis of “simplification” at each
transition from higher levels to lower ones for explanatory purposes. But the systems
approach does not randomly select systemic levels for such explanations but takes stable
(although non-equilibrium, NESS) physical objects
as systems used for explanations, and constructs explanations
principally multi-level/multi-scale - and without skipping over systemic levels to avoid falling into reductionism.

In classic reductionism, there are no multiple systemic levels in
explanations, and references are made only to lower levels.
In reductionism, there are no intellectual means to prevent
explaining human behavior even not through the behavior of brain neurons, but
through quantum-chemical processes involving electrons and
elementary particles of atomic nuclei, which underlie chemical
processes, or vice versa - cellular processes, based on
chemical processes with cellular molecules. Very trendy are also
explanations of how hormones at the biochemical level affect human
behavior (a human as a whole is many systemic levels above
the level of biochemistry happening in the brain). Of course, the biochemistry of brain function
affects human behavior, but this connection is so unobvious that
many systemic levels are needed to clarify it: the subject changes at each systemic level, roles focused on these levels handle them, and this knowledge is described in different literature. Thus,
an enormous amount of pop-psychological literature explaining
human behavior through low-level neurophysiological mechanisms
misleads, explains nothing, and does not provide a foundation for
reliable work on changing human behavior akin to engineering work. Pop-psychology is just that - pop-psychology, not adhering to rigorous
standards of thought work, only giving an illusion of “explanations.”
Why does a rocket fly? Because fuel oxidizes in it! Why does the brain
understand these lines? Because neurons are firing in it! All this is
true, but useless for substantial and accurate engineering work
truth. To make this truth useful and precise for engineering work,
multi-level (regarding systemic levels) examinations are needed, and they
should not skip considerations of high levels, not allow reductionism.

Let’s not reduce everything happening with a person to the realm of thought
work; a person also interacts with the physical world through bodily work.
Dancing, as one of the possible behaviors of a person (other
behaviors are life, rest, labor), can be “explained” reductively, as a set of chemical processes between molecules in
muscle tissue cells, or even as a set of movements of hundreds of muscles.
One could also mention that muscles are controlled by the brain, and during
dancing (life, rest, labor) the spinal cord is involved. But the emergencies
specific to dancing (properties inherent in the dancer as an agent role when dancing --- expressiveness, aesthetics, set of figures,
characteristic poses) will be missing, as will the discussion of the dancer and their
behavior (dancing). All these reductionist descriptions of
dancing as muscle work will be logically correct but these will be
reductionist descriptions, reducing emergent properties to the properties
of system parts, including parts lying many systemic levels below the level convenient for describing the discussed emergent property.

A herd of cows has tails (of Margarita’s cows), but discussing these tails,
one cannot discuss the herd. Discussing muscles and the spinal cord, one cannot discuss the dancer!
To discuss a dancer during dancing (and Vasya Pupkin is not a dancer if he does not dance --- when Vasya Pupkin has lunch, he is an “eater,” when he is treated - “a patient,” and a dancer --- only when dancing), one must describe both muscle movements, the work of the whole body in different “non-equilibrium balances,” using inertia of body parts (the head is 5.4 kg, a good swing of it will propel the body similarly as a melon of similar weight), principles of dance style (requiring aesthetics, culturally conditioned), how these principles are embodied in individual movements (dance vocabulary), and how these movements form an entire dance performance (choreography --- here), and why such dancing repeats in various dance master communities (e.g., why tango is danced in many places globally, and you can recognize it as tango, and people-agents dancing it somehow decide to learn and become tango masters --- that’s already community-level discussion, much beyond muscles!). Each step of this discussion involves separate objects; one cannot explain “how a dancer works” through “muscles and nerves,” a dancer's behavior is not expressible through the behavior of “muscles and nerves.” If describing a city block, one must not describe it through the arrangement and shape of bricks, even walls within buildings. One must describe the block through the location and shape of buildings and courtyards, lawns and squares, vacant lots and roads. Blocks, dancers, herds --- one must carefully consider at what “systemic level”/“object part level” we try to describe the system’s behavior as a whole.

Reductionist methods (describing a herd in terms of tails and horns, not cows) worked, but poorly. If reductionists happened to guess the convenient systemic level (a dancer using posture/“dance posture” methods, dance steps in rhythm, taking positions in a pair if it’s paired dances, a block consisting of buildings and courtyards, a herd of cows and bulls) --- reductionist methods worked, and when they did not guess (a dancer of muscles and bones, a block of bricks and blades of lawn grass, a herd of ears, legs, and tails), nothing good happened. Outwardly this seemed like “reductionism --- good!” (listing successful cases) and “reductionism --- harmful!” (listing unsuccessful cases).

A classical example of initial systems where the systems approach was honed as it emerged as general systems theory by Ludwig von Bertalanffy --- is a blooming meadow in spring. Hundreds of plant and animal species, soil, puddles and marshes left from floods. How to discuss the seasonal changes happening in a meadow? Biochemistry of interactions of all living cells of all animals and plant organisms on the blooming meadow? Obviously, this doesn’t work, although formally correct --- but how to translate this intuitively obvious “doesn’t work, although formally correct” to the level of a clear principle? Here’s where the concepts of systemic levels and emergency come into play, thereby the “systems approach” emerged as the transfer of the concept of “system” developed in physics to other fields. Discussing such a complex system as a blooming meadow became easier. This complex object “fits in the head,” thinking about it “falls into place.”

Emergency needs to be distinguished from **synergy** --- the effect of mutual amplification of properties. If upon merging two companies with small profits we observe their mutual benefit and profit sharply increase, we observe just a stronger resulting company, no systemic effect/emergency (appearance of new property, new characteristic, new subject of interest from interaction of parts of this whole) is present, just synergy of these initial companies in part of old properties. No new properties emerged, just past properties increased. No systemic effect, no emergency, no new subject and new roles associated with new properties of the whole made of synergistic parts of this whole. However, synergy is evident: properties strengthened! Systems approach has nothing to do with it.

But if you combine bricks and cement with water in the correct form, a house will emerge from their interaction --- and rooms, house residents can be discussed, which is impossible to discuss with just a solution and bricks. A brick in cement and water does not amplify anything, doesn’t contribute to anything, cement doesn’t amplify anything in the brick, but if taken in a sufficient and correct quantity and first combine cement with water (getting a solution: properties of the solution are not reducible to properties of water and properties of cement), and then bricks with the solution, you get a house --- house properties are incomparable with brick, cement, and water properties. And no synergy here, i.e., no mutual amplification of properties of cement, water, and bricks when combined in two levels: “bricks plus ‘cement plus water.’”

People live in houses, not in bricks, even if piled up. Formally reside in bricks with solution (reductionism!), but in these terms it’s hard to discuss living. For example, a house has an architectural style (in the sense of construction architecture, “visual image”) --- modern, baroque --- but bricks with solution have no architectural style, it’s not discussed in terms of bricks and solution, it’s just in houses in their finished form. But elements of this architectural style are simply the arrangement of bricks, the plain truth. This is reductionism, “truth but useless truth,” discussing the house this way is impossible! Synergy (adding parts without new qualities but changing old qualities of parts) can thereby be discussed within reductionism, while emergency/systemic excludes reductionism.

The second error corrected by systemic thinking is the opposite of reductionism **holism.** However, poorly skilled people (and probably inherited from AI agents) associate systemic thinking with holistic teachings, explaining system behavior by the behavior of its supersystem. Dancers dance as they do just because humanity sustains the subculture of dancing (for spectators, for themselves, even for friends: belly dance in harems developed precisely as such entertainment). This dance subculture as a set of memes in people’s heads (now also on other carriers --- cinema, social media videos) makes people dance exactly like they do, and muscles and nerves of people execute this “order of culture,” help reproduce dancing as spreading these memes, they cannot escape, because “behavior of lower systemic levels fully depends on what happens outside them,” the main thought of holism. For holism, dance culture arises not because people dance and their pattern set (methods of work), performances, and thoughts about dances are called culture, but rather, for holism --- people dance (a phenomenon of dance culture) because it’s required by dance culture (a meme of dance culture) as a set of all ideas/memes/thoughts about dances and related human behavior. And for holism, thoughts about posture, dance steps in rhythm, thoughts about “muscle twitches,” musculoskeletal system and its state in dancing are declared insignificant. For holism, all this “somehow itself aligns with societal order” (and don’t ask what “societal order” is: ideas of high levels associated with communities and societies are rather vague, no good ontologies, therefore the language is more artistic, easy to fantasize within, even anthropomorphizing society --- attributing it, say, an “order”).

We will not give detailed explanations of why pure holism is as erroneous as reductionism because the ridiculousness of holism statements is quickly exposed; hence it is rarer. But it also exists, holism is widespread in the humanitarian field. It’s hard to convince an engineer in locomotive building that a steam locomotive’s efficiency during operation is so low because rails and stations made it so, and not physical processes determining the steam locomotive’s efficiency compared to that of an electric train. But a humanist can easily claim a dance performance of a dancer exists as it happened --- directly due to “societal need.” What is this “societal need,” “society’s requests” --- let’s not discuss. But the words are familiar and cause no questions to humanists. Though questions exist: what is “need” in “society” of many individual people with completely different ideas about dances and not only dances, and how does it manifest in a specific performance in terms of muscle and nerve work?!

Systemic thinking is associated with holism because in multi-level considerations, the interaction of levels is taken into account (including inevitable conflicts leading to multi-level optimization of configurations for systems on all levels, resulting in disorderliness of these configurations and system complexity growth in evolution. Systemic thinking recognizes the existence of higher levels and their influence on the lower (influence of the whole on parts), as in holism. But systemic thinking also takes lower levels’ existence and their influence on higher into account (influence of parts on the whole), as in reductionism. And simultaneously, across many systemic levels top-down and bottom-up!

In modern (third generation) systemic thinking there is also talk of multi-level optimization of all these influences during evolution: because all these parts and wholes appeared as they are in evolution (bio/Darwinian, memetic, techno). In this, time scales tens of thousands longer than the time scales during systems' direct interaction during their use should be considered --- in dances some figure lasts half a second, but its emergence evolution took years, sometimes decades, and the appearance of muscles and nerves of dancing agents on slower-changing lower levels took millions of years, and this development continues. Thus, there is already a dance performance by an agent with six hands: two of their own and four mechanical from a backpack with manipulators^[<https://vk.com/wall-179019873_1747>],
the evolution of the dancing agent continues, but it is not very fast
evolution.

**Systemic thinking** **is both reductionist and holistic at the same time. Or neither reductionist nor holistic. It resolves contradictions between these two approaches to explaining system behavior.**
