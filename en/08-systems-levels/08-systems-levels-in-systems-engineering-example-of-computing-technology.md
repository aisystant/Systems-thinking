title: System Levels in Systems Engineering. Example of Computing Technology.
---

In modern computing technology, it is easy to count a dozen system levels. Here is an example of distinguishing these levels from lower to higher for classic computers (there are more, this is just an example of thinking about these levels, different manufacturers may distinguish them differently for different projects):

1.  Pure materials (silicon and carefully dosed "impurities" giving the effect of semiconductivity).
2.  Parts of a transistor (source-drain-gate).
3.  Field-effect transistor and inter-transistor connections.
4.  Logic elements (composed of several interconnected transistors).
5.  Arithmetic-logic unit/computer core, memory, and other parts of processors and various types of memory.
6.  Processors/chips: general purpose (CPU), graphics/matrix computing (GPU), network switching between processors, RAM.
7.  Computer boards with processors and memory, external devices (e.g., solid-state drives).
8.  Computer rack with multiple computer boards, input-output connection equipment, power and cooling system. Connection cables.
9.  Server rack for multiple computer racks with power and cooling.
10. Pods of several interconnected server racks.
11. Data center of several "pods", which may even include a telepresence robot with a camera for night observation. A data center-level supercomputer (as of June 2020, the seventh in the world in terms of power) could have been assembled several years ago in 3.5 weeks by just 6 engineers^[<https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/08/14/making-selene-pandemic-ai/>].

Pure materials on the scale of transistor parts are comparable in size to atoms (a reference in 2023 was 1 nanometer for production by 2030, although this is not entirely about the physical sizes of transistors^[<https://www.verdict.co.uk/rapidus-1-nm-chip-technology/>]). Data centers with supercomputers today are dozens of tons of equipment, hundreds of cubic meters in volume. Engineers organize their thinking around system levels: systems at each of these levels consist of parts of the lower level and are themselves part of systems of a higher level. Systems of each system level are developed by engineers skilled in solving problems of these levels. Together, all these levels provide computing power that cannot be achieved using a reductionist approach, "a supercomputer straight from pure materials" and even "a supercomputer from transistors."

**It is absolutely not necessary to call systems at all these levels**
**"system", "transistor system", "server rack system."** **System** **is 
a type of object. We can** **"conjugate"** **each word with its type, but 
it will sound strange. We do not say** **"the process flies the airplane system,"** **we say** **"the airplane flies."** 
**We do not say** **"central processor system in the computer system,"**
**we say** **"central processor in the computer."** This does not remove the fact 
that the thinking of computing technology engineers is systematic, their 
activity is organized around the system levels of computing technology, 
these system levels are many, and in our overly simplified example, there 
are eleven such levels.

The practice of omitting the type "system" (including the variety of system 
types—target, supersystem, subsystem, system in environment, and later, 
creation system) is important if you are talking to people unfamiliar with 
system thinking. For a colleague who is familiar with systems engineering 
and management standards or has at least taken our course, it is appropriate 
to say "X is a target system," equivalent to X::"target system." For other 
people, it is better to say "X" or "target X" or even "it is important to 
consider X," but the word "system" as a type belonging is best pronounced 
in your mind if the interlocutor is unfamiliar with these types. But for your 
thinking, tracking type belonging is essential!

Today's computing technology successes are achieved precisely by 
the multi-level organization of computers—from the level of the computer 
chip down to the parts of the transistor, and from the level of the "assembled 
computer" (the rack for the data center) to the level of the data center as 
a whole. This is exactly the same growth in complexity that occurs in biological 
evolution and is regulated by the same patterns^[We recall the sources where all 
this can be read in detail: first of all, you need to watch the film Frustrated 
magnetism in solids at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_frustration>, then 
<https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1807890115> and 
<https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2120037119>. With a caveat that the gene code 
is not contained within the target system itself, this system does not reproduce, 
it is made by creation systems/creators who have memory of the target system. 
But this changes little in the course of reasoning.]. The achievements of 
electrical engineering, rocket science, transport engineering, and generally 
engineering as a whole are achieved in exactly the same way, by the multi-level 
organization of their target systems and also the multi-level organization of 
creation systems (say, a factory for manufacturing semiconductor chips, a factory 
for producing rockets, etc.).

The division of labor among people follows the line of different types of 
systems and even different system levels of one type of system, as systems 
of different levels are created/constructed/enabled by different "methods of 
work"/"types of practices"/"content of labor" of various creators/constructors/
"enabling systems"/"creation systems" in various roles.

An engineer developing and producing pure materials for the semiconductor 
industry differs significantly in knowledge from the knowledge of an engineer 
producing semiconductor chips by the lithography method. Moreover, the skill 
of development and production will differ so much that different enterprises 
will deal with it (some only develop, others only produce—and the specialization 
of the engineers at these enterprises differs). This is the division of labor. 
The skill of these engineers producing pure materials, engineers producing chips 
(integrated circuits) from them significantly differs from the skill of engineers 
designing computer racks and producing these racks. But all these different types 
of tech-engineers and managers as engineers of organizations negotiate with 
each other about how systems of a lower system level are made into systems of a 
higher, more complex level—including the organization by managers of enterprises 
that will handle all this.

System thinking allows you not to lose focus in these complex collective 
negotiations regarding the creation and modification of multi-level engineering 
systems and the complex network of enterprises that produce these systems. 
Not a single transistor drain, not a single fan in the rack, not a single cable 
in the data center, not a single unit dealing with these systems, not a single 
type of equipment in these units, not a single category of clients, not a single 
category of suppliers, not a single law of those societies where all this should 
work and bring irreversible benefits to various agent-owners of various systems 
will be forgotten.
