title: 'System Levels. Continuation of the Example of Social Dances: Levels Above the Dancer.'
---

The salsaro::role story doesn't end there; a system thinker always looks at objects of ever-increasing scale, higher and higher system levels! Up from the level of salsaro::role goes artist::role—we have mentioned this repeatedly in previous paragraphs.

In the club, next to the dance style teacher (the "maker" of salsaros) stands a visiting Cuban, **choreographer::teacher::creator**, who has just conducted a master class on how to build **composition** in salsa figures/moves, and he is observing the next system level of mastery of a special method: the method of actions of artist::role, who performs certain actions (it is not customary to call it "work" in dance) during a "dance set"/performance. In social dances, it is customary for the composition/choreography of dancing to be created "on the fly" by the same agents who dance this composition in the roles of **artists.** The sub-roles of artists dancing the choreography (a composition of figures corresponding to certain artistic criteria) at the previous system level were called "salsaros," and their method/style was "dancing salsa"—but there was no talk of composition (or rather "and this composition too," that is, "salsa in general, all variations of composition," not a specific set with its unique choreography/composition). One level below were simply "dancers" whose behavior was "dancing," and there was no salsa yet (or rather, "salsa too, if needed"). One level below, they were just "movers," and their behavior was "body movement," with no dancing at all (or rather, "dancing too, if needed"). And so on—for each creator role at a certain role level, its target mastery::system and the method/style::"function of mastery" produced by this mastery (which is metonymically applied to the agent role—practice is considered performed not by mastery as part of personality, but by the role of the entire agent, "not the tiger's eye sees, but the whole tiger sees"—but these are ontological subtleties).

So, what system does each creator (doctor, coach, various teachers) work with in an agent dancing with his partner in the club? Each type/specialization of the creator—his own system! **The system is in the eyes of the beholder, or rather, in the eyes of the creator (because it's not about passive observation but active creation).** All kinds of creators look at the same agent dancing in the club—but see absolutely different things, speak different languages of different subject areas, create different parts in the agent (including physically different ones—let's say, affecting physically different neurons encoding this or that mastery).

This is the manifestation of emergence: at each system level, the objects of consideration change, new properties appear that did not exist at lower levels and will no longer exist at higher levels. Therefore, at each system level, the subject area changes, its objects are subject to their specific methods, performed by their subject-specific roles, and these roles have their subject-specific interests.

The choreographer::(role of the creator of the method for a specific variant of a dance set) carefully looks at the couple—and sees (focuses attention!) not muscles, not separate arm or leg movements, but a sequence of figures/pa/steps/moves somehow tied to musical accents, and this narrative (sequence) assembles into a whole performance/set, lasting five minutes (surprisingly, in social dances there is no separate word for this performance/set/execution, it is just called "dance"). The choreographer evaluates: did a decent choreography (sometimes shortened to "choreo") come out in which various salsa figures are balanced, if there are any trendy features (e.g., inserts from other dance styles), if there is some interesting composition. This is the level of **dance performance/set** as a whole^[The level of composition is described in more detail here --- <https://vk.com/wall-179019873_432>]—what story/narrative will be told by the artist::role, how the rhythm of the movement of artists performing the choreography (a sequence of certain moves intended by the choreographer) matches the music's rhythm in larger structures (not at the level of one beat or one move but at the level of musical phrases and longer structures), will the set of figures be unexpected, varied, and interesting or boring and monotonous.

The ambiguous word "dance" (which is both a special movement method and a style within the general movement method, as well as the performance/set of some choreography) was not used here, and for educational purposes, many synonyms for terms were given and types explicitly stated. Therefore, the language of talking about the situation in the club (salsa dance set/performance) turned out to be a bit awkward, but more precise. "Club dancers" are unlikely to grasp this text; to understand it, one must first go through "Rational Work" and then "System Thinking" right up to this place you are reading now.

No wonder agents learn the mastery of performing the role of an artist, "dance style dancer," dancer, mover (the chosen path from the top to the base of the part-whole hierarchy we will call "system stack"—here, a stack of mastery, determining a stack of possible role executions in the stack of methods) for many years to achieve some decent mastery at each level. These agents do not get precise engineering explanations but just many examples of these very "dance sets," and simply try to repeat what they understood, also hoping that different exercises (for example, strength training, stretching, etc.) will help them in the performance.

It is particularly emphasized: a certain degree of mastery is required at each level! For if you are very good at building composition but very poorly perform the style of some dance (for example, salsa), while being a good dancer and an excellent mover, you will not be recognized as "one of their own" in the community of dancers of some style. Similarly, imagine a Greco-Roman wrestler who is perfect in controlling his body because he "spent a lot of time on his body." He steps onto the dance floor—and alas, watching him dance will be impossible, but watching him wrestle—fine. One must understand what is specifically dance-like, style-like, choreographic/composition-like in body movements. This is true for many methods: a person with tremendous intellect (the lower mastery level for many applied methods) in any applied method he hasn't learned will look roughly as ridiculous as an excellent mover in dances if he hasn't learned dances but applied his movement mastery in another area (say, wrestling or weightlifting). This reasoning also applies to an engineer who developed his engineering mastery, say, in electronics or software engineering, and then suddenly started teaching people (methods of personal engineering) or organizations (management methods). The expectation of success is about the same as for a wrestler or weightlifter in dances. On the other hand, the needed level of dance mastery will be acquired faster by an agent with the mastery and body of a weightlifter or wrestler than "a person from the street" without movement mastery at the level of this agent-wrestler or agent-weightlifter. And the required level of teaching personality mastery or organizational teaching mastery (management) will be achieved faster by an agent with the mastery of an engineer than someone without systemic engineering mastery (general engineering knowledge for all types of created and developed systems).

We cannot change how people speak or create some special language (although engineers, mathematicians, physicists do exactly that, creating terminology for their subject areas quite consciously). The word "dance" will still come up, and you will need to independently determine—what kind of object it is, of what type, what is meant. And this will be true for almost all the terms we used in the story. So, you can call **salsa** both a dance style (the postures—poses with prescribed muscle work in this pose, the rhythm of the step and some characteristic figures/steps/moves performed in the performance by the salsaro), and a specific performance in the salsa style (lasting five minutes)! Moreover, when we talked about a coach, we described a situation where it could easily be confused between the coach-as-role and the coach-as-person::agent in the coach role, who simultaneously plays the roles of a body instructor and fitness instructor. A composition may be the result of applying composition methods (the sequence of figures in the performance, or sometimes even the description of the sequence of figures, not the sequence of figures as a dynamic 4D object), and it may also be a method of work, i.e., behavior—what the choreographer does, "performance composer." Attention to the types of each term and asking clarifying questions in case of misunderstanding are essential!

**Understanding ontology and semantics is necessary to discuss things**
**systemically!** For instance, furniture can refer to all the furniture in an apartment, a table with chairs, or just a chair—it is all furniture, but each time we need to clarify what is meant. As for the terms "entrepreneur" (we do not recommend its usage, in the mind of each agent—both human and AI—this implies entirely different types) and stakeholder (roles and agent-in-role, as well as any role and external role of a project are confused).

With the term "dance," it's the same: always clarify whether it's any dance, a specific style, or a specific performance/set. To keep from getting confused and maintaining focus on the chosen system level and its concepts, one needs diligence, and recording things is recommended rather than just waving hands. We described the situation in the club over dozens of pages, but a set in social dances is just two people for five minutes. In describing an enterprise, you'll easily uncover a system of two thousand agents with their equipment, hundreds of roles, and considered project timelines—years or even decades.
**Discussions** **about roles and their** **methods, as well as the development of the enterprise as the creation of its material base (tools) and mastery (this will be mastery of employees and computer programs of the enterprise) will be approximately similar to the situation of dance in the club,** **only the roles and** **methods will be** **in thousands. Without the habit of precisely** **assigning** **object types and documenting/recording** **descriptions** **of clarified** **objects** **in their various relationships and types—you will be lost.**

But the story doesn't end with the choreographer and his methods of choreography/"dance composition"; one can go up the levels quite long, finding something interesting each time. **Requests** **"what is it for"** **always go from top down** **through system levels, meaning from the functions of larger systems to the functions of smaller systems** **(for example, the request for body control comes from choreography if there is some tricky turn disrupting body balance), and solving these requests (and vice versa understanding that with the current "element base" of lower levels the request cannot be solved)—** **from bottom up.** In other words, to be ready for any choreography, you need to be a good mover/physical culturist, and further down—have good health. Remember, a "healthy person" can also be singled out in this situation, attention can (consciously! controllably!) switch from the "artist" to many levels down to the "healthy person" (a sick person won't be able to dance salsa! Or practice Greco-Roman wrestling, or come to the "combat" as an analog of the "dance set").

But to answer the question "what is happening in this dancing," one needs to continue climbing system levels up.

Next (at the same time!) on the edge of the dance floor stands the **organizer (org)** of the **salsateka** (salsa party—salsateka, tango party—milonga, hustle party—disco) and evaluates the salsateka as a party/event in general. For him, the dancing couple are **participants** **in the project "creating** **and developing** **the salsateka::party::event."** Because a dance party mainly consists of these dance performances/sets, multiple sets are happening simultaneously on the dance floor (many couples are dancing), and they follow one another—with every new music track comes a new dance set; say, with fifty dance pairs. The org considers both these performances and the standing/non-dancing partners with their imbalance (imbalance is a specific term for a party, when the number of partners and partners is unequal: not everyone will be able to get on the dance floor, even if they want to!), DJs, photographers and videographers, and even cloakroom attendants (because the party begins, like in theater, with a coat check).

What is discussed at this **event/party level**? Read social networks where dances are discussed. You'll find that this level is most discussed, not so much by dancers::role or "style dancers"::role but by "party participants"::role (but all these roles are the same people-agents, and performing these roles simultaneously):

-   how much you dance or don't dance (because there's no one to dance with—couldn't find a partner due to gender imbalance, or a partner refused to dance, or it was too hot, or something else happened^[Example of topics discussed at this level ---
<https://vk.com/wall-179019873_1740>]),
- what mood you have after the party, where to go to have a good dance (i.e., to get a good mood—which orgs guarantee a good mood at their parties, and who can't guarantee anything?),
-   what music should play at these parties to make it interesting to dance to and for all participants to have a good mood,
-   how much all this should cost, who might get in for free.
-   ... and so on: passions run high, all revolves around the bad or good mood at parties, adequacy of money spent on the event and the pleasure from the event, alternative behavior (where else to go for similar money for more fun).

Notice, the actual dance movement::method and creating choreography/composition::method (what happens during the dance sets/performances) are almost never discussed in social networks! In common usage, a party is often called "dances"—the same "dance," just in plural! And the pattern/method/style of actions of going to parties will be called "dancing" ("activity" in terms of time spent), and dance lessons to achieve dance mastery are also called "dancing." Everything gets mixed up, including "time to develop the skill of participating in a party" and "time to use the skill of participating in a party." The skill of "participating in a party" (according to performed practice) or the skill of "party participant" (according to the role played) includes the skill of performing numerous previously mentioned functions/methods, from operating an organism (subject of interest to a physiologist) to the culture/methods of participating in a party, performed by the "party participant" role and involving appropriate behavior there. This is the time of using the party participant's skill in its sub-role of artist. And the time of creation? Remember all those trainers, instructors, style gurus, choreographers—and the person::agent who will soon participate in the party but does not yet have the skills to consciously or unconsciously choose the participation method.

The next system level already does not have those who specifically deal with it, but sometimes some party organizers, teachers, or even individual dancers suddenly act as **"ambassadors of subculture"**::role and begin to discuss how they develop the salsa subculture with its numerous **non-conformists**::role. Here, salsa party participants and those leading a special lifestyle related to this are non-conformists::role, and the name of our dancing couple has changed again! This is the system **subculture level** of a particular dance style, in our case, salsa, but usually, in such subcultures, they dance some "umbrella" of dance styles gathered around one dance. So, in the salsa subculture, they often dance both Cuban son, as well as unexpectedly Dominican bachata and bachata sensual, in the kizomba subculture they dance not only kizomba, but also semba, urban kiz, tarraxinha, tarraxo, unexpectedly Hawaiian compa, as well as Afro-house (in the form of "animation/entertainment" of party participants—guided line
dance^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_dance>]).

**The community/gathering as a group/collective** **agent performing the role of subculture** **and practicing maintenance/replication and development of the social dance meme for some dance style,** includes all the parties of the "umbrella" dance style (in this case—"umbrella" salsa). For example, in Moscow, there are five to six parties simultaneously. This community features all dance schools where trainers, style gurus, and choreographers work (in Moscow for salsa, there are more than ten). Schools teach (replication of the subculture meme), parties entertain (using mastery of various subcultures/“methods of actions” by its adepts::“carriers of the subculture meme”), and there are also competitions and festivals. Subculture/community, therefore, is quite material. Let's say, a hundred years ago, the salsa subculture as all these constantly held parties-schools-competitions with their numerous participants in various roles (not everyone there dances!) did not yet exist, and in a hundred years, it probably will not exist anymore. In the Arctic and Antarctic, there is no salsa subculture even now. The subculture can be considered not only as a method of actions but as a functional object, which occupies a certain place in space-time, that is, coincides with the construct: the community, "people practicing certain methods, carriers of the subculture meme," because at this level we speak more about creating and developing some mastery, some practice of this mastery (actions determined by mastery), the evolution of practice, thus changing the language of discussion. A subculture can be thought of as a material object, it changes over time, although the time scale has changed again. These are not fractions of a second for the bodily work of the musculoskeletal system or soma sensation changes, not a second or two for a single movement, not three minutes for a set/performance, not three hours for a party. Changes in subculture (changes in the replicating meme with the ideas of some social dance style, this meme and defines the subculture—as the genome defines a living species, and not a phenome, not an organism, so here—not a subculture member defines the subculture, but a meme replicated in his head) take not months, but years. The subculture evolves along with all its behavior methods/styles, performed by the roles of collective and individual agents and even parts of agents.

System thinking helps us reduce the complexity of thinking about a subculture, an incredibly complex multi-level object. We just have to think separately about each system level, manage our attention when switching from level to level, track the attention of different roles to different phenomena at different levels (primarily to what they do: attention to methods/practices of all roles).

All these roles and their methods of actions (often say "methods of behavior," but a method is also behavior, a method is executed, it is an action pattern, so there is some ontological jitter here due to not distinguishing method and work as different types
