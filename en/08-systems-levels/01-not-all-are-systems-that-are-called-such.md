title: Not everything called a system is one
---

All the various definitions of a system agree on one thing: **a system
as a whole consists of interacting parts, which in their interaction
produce** **emergence/system effect**, i.e., when parts of the system
interact, the whole system exhibits new (emergent) properties that the
individual parts do not possess. In simple terms, gears and springs in
mechanical wall clocks have their own properties (for example, gears -
accuracy in manufacturing and wear resistance, springs - elasticity),
but the clock as a whole, composed of these gears and springs, has
completely different properties (for example, timekeeping accuracy,
dimensions), and the interior of a house, as a whole consisting of
clocks, walls, furniture, household items, and decorations, has yet
another set of properties (for example, convenience of passage,
lighting). Emergence is precisely what happens when “timekeeping
accuracy” emerges as attention shifts from the parts of the clock to
the whole clock, and convenience of passage emerges when attention
shifts from the clock to the interior as a whole. This is important for
the division of labor: accuracy in manufacturing gears is usually
handled by certain people (we write “people” for simplicity, though it
would be more accurate to write "agents") with a high level of skill in
precise metalwork, timekeeping accuracy by other people, clock
engineers, and convenience of passage in an interior by yet others,
interior designers.

Nuances might differ, but the assembly of parts (here we’re talking
about assembly, not division into parts, the relation of composition),
interaction of assembled parts, and the resulting emergence/system
effect are present in all schools of systems thinking. Different
schools of systems thinking have two traditions of interpreting the
relationship between parts and whole: the engineering tradition, where
parts can only be physical objects, and the general philosophical
tradition, where parts can be of any nature—both physical and mental
objects.

**Our interpretation in the course is** **engineering,** material/physical, where **we’re talking about parts of the system as physical objects** **in** **space-time. We more or less adhere to the provisions of the engineering ontological standard ISO 15926-2:2003.** **A part can be** **a role-playing object, but only when this role of the object-part is played by some constructive object** **or even a group of constructs.** **A part can be a place in space—** **but in physical space, not** **“mental”/mathematical space.**

We do not recommend considering processes::behavior as parts of the
system, but the parts of the system themselves and the system as a
whole must have behavior: changes in the state of parts and the system
as a whole during the interaction of parts. The behavior of gears in a
clock—they rotate and transmit motion, the behavior of springs—they
compress and decompress, storing and releasing energy, the behavior of
the clock—they “run” and show time, the behavior of the
interior—it provides convenience for anthropomorphic agents (humans
and robots) and is well-lit both during the day and at night. These
changes in state (assembly of the system from parts during creation,
some changes of parts during use) are “behavior,” so we always tie the
consideration of processes to the physical world: processes are
represented by the parts involved in these state changes. If one wants
to show the process of “an apple falling,” it’s necessary to present it as
an apple, a section of the Earth under the apple, and changes in the
apple's state (its relative speed to the section of the Earth and the
distance between the apple and the Earth during vertical falling). Everything is material.

In the material/physical variant, parts do not exist for abstract/ideal/mathematical objects (classes, types, sets, etc.) because these parts are not physical: they do not have volume in the physical world they occupy, so it is unclear what consists of what. For example, it’s impossible to verify that all “mathematical molecules” as parts are included in the number of “mathematical cells” or “mathematical organisms” because it’s impossible to interpret a part as a part of the space-time volume occupied by the whole.

We reject systems thinking using the concept of “part” for non-physical/mathematical/mental objects (e.g., descriptions: talking about parts of paintings, parts of texts), because it will be completely unclear what the “interaction” giving the system effect is for parts as non-physical objects. Most often, one can hear about some algorithm that performs computations involving several non-physical objects at once—but these objects themselves do not interact; the conversation shifts to the computer with its algorithm and its methods of operation! This is constructivism in mathematics, a shift to operations of creating objects instead of discussing relationships between objects. In our version of systems thinking, we do not follow this approach in constructive mathematics; instead, we adhere to the engineering tradition of excluding mathematical objects from consideration as complete systems.

It must be noted that research is indeed underway exactly along this line of constructivism in mathematics: if we include in the consideration not the mental objects themselves but computers or their generalizations—creators/constructors, working with descriptions by some algorithms, and express the descriptions themselves as operations for constructing these descriptions (constructivism in mathematics), then we can approach systems thinking for mental/mathematical objects. But this is the frontier; there are currently no applications for this approach in engineering and management methods, and we will elaborate on this further in the course and provide literature—for the most curious. For now, let’s leave it: systems are always physical, always material.

This “physical” (but also role-playing, constructive, spatial, etc.—they all ultimately base on the physicality of the system and its parts) interpretation of dividing a system into parts is our version of the systems approach. This interpretation is chosen due to the criterion of adequacy of thinking: **our thinking about systems is always consistent with the physical world.**

Our projects for creating and developing systems always somehow change the physical world; they are not fantasy. Deliberations about systems are thereby grounded/grounded, meaning all abstractions eventually have foundations in situations in the physical world, they are not pure “mind games”; physically impossible situations are tracked and excluded from considerations. If nothing happens in the physical world as a result of our projects, we do not engage in such projects: our thought always ultimately relies on the physical world.

In many other interpretations of the systems approach (e.g., in the classic and rather outdated “general systems theory” [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_system_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_system_theory)]), the word “part” is used informally, loosely, and the “whole” is assembled from a variety of objects, including abstract ones that are poorly defined in terms of their presence in the physical world: physical objects (as in our case!), but also words, rules, moods, intentions—anything. **In our version of the systems approach, we** **will not** **consider** **non-physical/abstract** **objects** **as systems** **or parts of systems.** **Descriptions live in the world of concepts/mathematical world;
they are not systems.**

Thus, we do not recognize different “systems of knowledge/rules” as systems from the systems approach—bodies of knowledge, sets of rules, and even a system of equations as a “set of regularities”. Stanislavski’s system, Montessori’s system, Plato’s system, the political system, the “minus 60” system (this is what one set of weight-loss rules is called), the legislative system—all these are abstract wholes consisting of some abstract parts-elements (knowledge, rules, sometimes even implied/implicit/unexpressed/tacit—not expressed in signs on a medium, i.e., not documented)—all these “systems” (in quotes for our version of the systems approach!) do not occupy space in the space-time continuum. They are not real systems from the systems approach; they are only called “systems” in another lexical sense. Very often, people use the word “system” just to indicate that they have thought in some way while assembling some parts of this knowledge, somehow aligning this knowledge, rules, equations with each other, creating some structure. For example, grouping all rules into separate groups of rules, including something, excluding something—even (non-spatial!) “boundaries” exist, separating “included” from “not included”. But the term “part” for such usage of the word “system” in other (not from the systems approach) lexical senses here does not denote a physical object; it does not occupy space/place in the space-time continuum, these “parts” usually do not even form a hierarchy in terms of the “part-whole” relationship among physical objects.

Algorithms are not systems either, including algorithms/knowledge/theories/methods of work disciplines::“generalized algorithms for constructor”, and “generalized algorithms for tasks performed by the creator” (algorithms/knowledge of methods where material/physical types of
processed material and use of equipment for working with such material
are substituted). All such “algorithms” are for universal (Turing complete) computers/computers (physical, storing state on a material medium!) and universal converters-creators/constructors (which are physical!), operating according to the slightly extended concept of an algorithm (i.e., description of a work method), as described in constructor theory. True systems here are:

-   Universal (Turing complete) computers/computers (classical,
    quantum, neuromorphic, optical, etc.) “executing algorithms”
    / “following theories” / “making inferences based on existing
    knowledge”. If there are multiple algorithms, and the conversation
    involves “systems of algorithms”, these are “non-true systems from the
    systems approach”, but merely a term denoting a considered set of
    descriptions (much like talking about “systems of equations”).
-   Universal creators/constructors (machines, robots, people,
    organizations of all these), performing work according to some
    algorithms/knowledge/explanations described in
    textbooks/regulations/instructions/codes on work methods (often for
    inanimate constructors, they are not called methods/practices/work
    cultures but simply functions—the lathe performs the function of
    turning a part, but the agent-lathe operator—follows the methods of
    turning parts). If “system of work methods”::“set of behaviors” or
    “system of descriptions”::information is mentioned, these are
    “non-true systems from the systems approach”, the word “system” is also
    used as a reference to a considered set of descriptions.

Another class of non-systems from the systems approach due to their
abstractness (nonexistence in the world, absence of occupied space in
the space-time continuum)—**systematics/taxonomies**. In systematics/taxonomies, the discussion involves classifiers: classes of classes (sets of sets), which ultimately classify somewhat similar systems (physical and abstract). These are hierarchies built using two types of relations: **classification** (classification, “subsuming under a class,” including elements in a set) and **specialization** (specialization, genus-species, subsets in a set). Lamarck’s classifier (Lamarck’s system) consists of classes of somewhat similar animals, the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC, decimal classification system) classifies books, grouping in its classes books somewhat similar in content, The All-Russian classifier of products and design documents OK 012-93 (ESKD classifier, unified design documentation system, which itself is a system of knowledge/rules)—all these are not true
individual systems, they are merely classifiers for classes of systems
(physical, as we understand them in our version of the systems approach)
and classes of abstract objects. Nevertheless, classifiers are useful
as they provide names for systems, meaning that when encountering a
classifier, it is helpful to look not at the classifier itself but at
the physical objects being classified. And then clarify that the
classifier merely describes an object that may have many descriptions.
“A rose by any other name would smell as sweet”: one and the same object
could be easily classified by different classifiers, i.e., described
differently, have different names, belong to different
classes/sets/taxa/types depending on the classification goals. In any
case, this problem can be solved only by discussing the system and
distinguishing it from discussing the classifier.

A “terminology dispute” is futile, avoid it. Questions like “Is
object X of type Y?” are interesting only when it is some classifier, the
results of classification by which will have material consequences.
Usually, this is a state-approved classifier, like the disease
classifier, from which your disability status will follow under the
disability classifier, and from being classified into a disability group
will come the receipt or non-receipt of a pension. From the classification or non-classification of some subspecies of tiger to the species of tigers, in general, nothing depends. But if it is a species listed in the Red Book prescribed by legislation, the consequences are clear: fines for hunters.

The activity type classifier (essentially, it is a classifier by types of work methods) can be important if some types of activities need to be specified in a charter, and non-compliance leads to penalties, or if the type of activity is licensed, and the outcome is again penalties—I think you get the idea. There are quite a few such classifiers where classification leads to some administrative consequences ^[<https://classifikators.ru/>]. In
any other cases, systematics are interesting for roughly specifying the topic of conversation but can be changed at any moment, systems can be described in various ways, and they do not change from changing the way they are described: a hundred different photographers and a hundred different artists will produce 200 images of the Eiffel Tower, and it will remain unchanged. Systematics used for design are more interesting, but anyway, several such systematics can be used at any given time.

So, systematics, “classification systems,” taxonomies are interesting as hints that they classify some real/material/physical systems. As always: if you encounter a “description” while searching for systems, look for what is described—systems may be there. But they might not be, check, descriptions can describe descriptions as well. Classifiers as systematics can easily classify non-systems and some descriptions (other classifiers, for example).

So **not everything called a system::“type from the meta-meta-model in the systems approach”/“type from the ontology of the systems approach” is really a system::term/word/name. And not everything not called a system::type isn’t a system::term/word/name!** For example, few would call a household refrigerator a “food cooling system” (but not a household refrigerator—easily), but in the systems approach, it would clearly be a “household refrigerator”::system. **The type “system” is given to some physical object by a creator in some role, who for some reason needed this system and highlighted it with their attention from the variety of different physical objects in the surrounding world.**
