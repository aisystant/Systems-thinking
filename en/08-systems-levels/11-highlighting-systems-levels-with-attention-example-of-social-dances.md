title: Highlighting system levels through attention. An example of social dances
---

And only at a higher level does **dancing/dance movement** appear, when the **dance teacher** (creator of dance mastery in students) observes how their student-**dancers** (bearers of dance mastery) move — assuming aesthetic poses, executing smooth leading and sensitive following, not losing balance in turns. Previous roles (fitness instructor, rhythm instructor, coach) did not see dancers, they just saw moving people, they saw fitness practitioners (their creator — fitness instructor), body practitioners (their creator — body instructor), movers (their creator — coach and helping rhythm instructor) — it didn't matter what type of cultural movement it was, it could be parkour, it could be figure skating. Here, however, we are talking about a specific type of cultural movement: **dance movement** (rather than movement in judo, equestrian sports, or karting).

But at this level, it is still unknown — what specific dance style/culture this movement belongs to. It takes a long time to learn to dance a particular style (tango, ballet, salsa). Different assessments are given for different dance styles and abilities of dancers, but ballet can easily take a decade to learn, hip-hop about five years, social dances — about three years. We simply bracket out, focusing attention on the general movement method for all dances, distinguishing them from all other cultural movement methods, assuming that one can learn the dance movement method once — and use it in all «dance styles»/«types of dance movement methods». For example, learning to dance in pairs, that is, to be able to lead and follow, synchronize one's movement with a partner's. This is needed in all social dance styles (though not just social, pair dancing can also be ballroom, stage, and even in ballet^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partner_dance>]).
One can be taught not just to "step," but to make a specific **dance step**, with its own specificity (it contains built-in "illusion," unusualness/unreality). This is also needed for all dances, and learning it once, one can use it in all dances thereafter!

«Bracketing out» learning to dance as such, in contrast to learning a specific dance style, is the idea of multi-dance::«dance method». Our dancer::role is a multi-dance dancer, already sufficiently trained to easily master different dance styles: they have body control during general movement set, they have mastered general dance movement and need to just further acquire the mastery of a specific dance style.

So, the next observer of our dancing couple is the **salsa teacher::**«guru of a specific dance style»**.** They look at how their student-**salsa dancers** step in rhythm (those who dance salsa, one is a salsero, two are salseros, this is the plural in Spanish). The salsa teacher observes the same couple, at the same moment as the physiologist, the coach, and the general level dance teacher. But the salsa teacher sees the couple with completely different eyes (meaning different points of interest). They focus on the qualitative performance of the method of **«stylish dancing»/«maintaining dance style»** (dancing with adherence to a specific dance style, in this case, Cuban salsa), and their points of interest include: what postures (structure of effort in the body while maintaining characteristic poses), how dancers hit the music rhythm, transferring weight from foot to foot while making very specific movements of salsa (not tango, not balboa, not kizomba), how the dancers are dressed, how they move across the dance floor (stand in place, or «walk»). This is the dance style: how dancers step to music in a specific dance, regardless of the method of performing a specific «dance figure»/pa/pas/step/step/move/«lexical unit».

So, in salsa, it is not so much that the leader pushes the follower for a step, but rather the leader pushes off from the follower — and both «fly away» from the point of contact at roughly equal distance. The dance is not reduced to the leader spinning the follower around; the dance pattern is more or less symmetric in terms of both partners' movements — both cover roughly the same distance in the dance. And this happens throughout the salsa performance duration, in every movement, with a vast variety of dance figures — the style is maintained independently of the dance figures. One can learn the dance style (sometimes called «base») for a long time. One can step like in the army, the same way in every step, even in the dance step, or one can introduce nuances — even in simple steps, with good mastery of the base, opens up a whole world of variety in the steps. On these nuanced steps, the salsero builds many movements for themselves and their partner, characteristic precisely of salsa — rotations, movements.

The salsa guru looks at how our couple performs the figures/pa shown to them: spinning where necessary, stepping where necessary, in the rhythm and maintaining the posture that should be in salsa as opposed to, for example, tango or parkour with figure skating.

The method of stylish (maintaining a specific dance style/culture of movement) salsa dancing includes specific pas/figures/steps/moves (for example, enchufla, sombrero^[<https://salsaselfie.com/all-cuban-salsa-moves/>]), performed by dancers, thus turning into salseros. A salsero (the role of someone dancing salsa::style agent) is an over-role of a dancer. It is precisely an over-role, that means «more than just a dancer»: a salsero not only has to dance «in general» (that is, be able to move somewhat dance-like to music/be a dancer), but also has to be able to incorporate the specifics of salsa into their movements, «be in style». This means that a salsero has mastery greater than «just a dancer» — it is a higher systemic level. An engineer-programmer is more than «just an engineer»: they possess general engineering specificity (know systems engineering) and besides that, can also program. This is a general discussion about stacks of system levels in their role-based consideration, similar for various types of systems.

Let's recall the division of labor: different sub-roles usually can be performed by separate individuals, but due to the specifics of dancing — they cannot; it requires combining all roles in one agent. However, the roles of creators due to the deepening specialization of labor — they can be separated, and adjustment of the organism by a doctor, tuning of the body by a coach, dance training by a dance teacher, teaching a specific dance style by a style teacher — this can (and, for the most part, should) be done by different agents, each of whom has enough time to master the creation of the corresponding target mastery in the dancing agent.

How to determine if here the sub-roles are a specialization relation or a part-whole relation? In functional decomposition, it is easy to get confused, but generally follows a principle of dealing with these «sub-roles»:
**if given some ** **mutually exclusive** **alternatives** **of methods** **of roles in one agent, it’s a specialization (say, «wall builder —** **concrete worker** **for slip formwork** **or mason** **for brickwork»), and** **if both are needed to perform the full method** **one and the other («builder —** **mason for brickwork» or «builder —** **painter for facade painting»)**
**these are levels of part-whole, system levels, i.e., a composition relationship.**

And of course, it is important to understand what the project is — in different projects, different decisions might be made on how to model methods of work/actions and the roles performing them, how to name these methods and roles. What in one project might be «variations»/specializations, in another project can easily turn out to be levels/parts (and for the nuances, why so, one must ask the participants of that project). **With attention, you highlight objects to** **agree on joint activities in** **the project, and not somehow «absolutely objectively, regardless of** **the situation, one modeling for all projects.» **The very concepts**
**of «method», «role» —** **they are part of the meta-meta-model of the world, from our courses, they are «for all projects». But the meta-model, types of which are taken from the meta-meta-model —** **it significantly depends on the subject area.**

Let's say, in the applied field of social dances, there is «salsero», and there is «tanguero» (the role that dances the style of Argentine tango), these are usually mutually exclusive options in one performance. Thus, an artist::role may have sub-role specializations (subtypes) salsero and tanguero, involved in different projects, and yet a sub-role specialization pianist as an over-role of a musician. Think, why a pianist — is an over-role of a musician, and not a sub-role (the same reason why salsero is a sub-role of an artist but an over-role of a dancer).

But if in a performance an artist suddenly needs to dance two dances for some purpose, these will be sub-roles-parts of a multi-dancer::role. The parts of the multi-dancer are salsero and tanguero, and their part is a dancer.

Let’s explain this with an example of a simpler physical system. A house-super-system has parts «interior wall» and «facade», in both these parts there is a sub-part «brick»: reasoning with the roles of artists is the same — and remember, this is reasoning «in types», since structurally bricks in the wall and facade are different, but of the same type «brick», and in the brain, the mastery of salsero and tanguero have one and the same dancer's mastery, but it works twice with different parameters. Mastery is a «program» (algorithm executed by the organism's computer and its attached tools) to perform a certain method (in our case — salsa dancing and tango dancing). Therefore, analogies with programming are appropriate: mastery as a program can run twice, preserving and recording in memory two sets of states from two different executions as physical processes. Mastery, like a program, can be represented by different physical objects if it is re-entrant^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrant)], that is, different instances of program variable/state memory do not affect each other. These are all ontological arguments, systemic thinking is impossible without mastering modeling.

Modeling — is primarily the assignment of a type of some meta-model to model objects, performed at many metalevels of abstraction. Thus, systemic thinking, which primarily includes systemic modeling and subsequent operations with the model, is impossible «in general», without linking to a project: in different projects, systemic thinking will answer the same question differently, leading to different system descriptions — because the same meta-meta-model type can be assigned to different subject area types depending on what division of labor we are working with in different projects.

**It's a common mistake: to demand an unequivocal version of systemic modeling (assigning objects the type of meta-meta-model of the systemic approach) for some set of systems, without explaining the project for which this modeling is done.** For example, during the creation of the Tesla electric car, a fleet/fleet (the general name for the system of transportation means, if it's passive transport, such as carts or cars — this would be a pool/pool) of electric cars and their sales and technical service departments was being primarily created. Later, however, a separate project had to be made — the Tesla charging station project across the US, and then worldwide. One can discuss forever: what system is Tesla creating? It is the same issue as that of a biological individual: it is impossible to name this system. Similarly, if you consider Tesla plants created by Tesla: and there would be about the same questions — say, where to classify the Tesla Optimus humanoid robot, which will replace workers — should this be considered as conditional «employees» or as «equipment»? And they want to sell this robot along with cars, complicating the matter. It is unlikely you will know how they agreed in Tesla to conduct system boundaries, system level boundaries, this is not public information — but they definitely agreed on this.

Modeling is not done just for fun: it must each time facilitate collective thinking in the project of system creation! Selecting types of objects and types of relationships to model objects and relationships from real situations of real projects is difficult, and largely subjective. One cannot specify ahead of time, «in such a general situation, choose certain types», it does not turn out that way. In ontology, the choice of relationship type from their multitude for building a hierarchy (classification, specialization, composition as main) — is primarily subjective preferences in modeling, reflecting various relationships of objects of the surrounding world. In different situations, different choices are possible, there's no unequivocally correct one! In systemic thinking, there's no «recipe», but there are types of objects that can be tried to use with the highest probability of obtaining understandable and logical reasoning for the various project participants. However, leaping from this «with the highest probability» to «guaranteed to get it» — won't work. Also, take into account the use of natural language: if something can be understood incorrectly by some project participants (e.g., the term being interpreted «mundanely»), it definitely will be. Therefore, document models and add grounding, i.e., real-life examples. If you have made a completely wrong choice, you will catch the mistake sooner.

Agents performing roles of salseros in a pair are **focused**/«ultimately attentive, performing a psychopractice of maintaining multi-threaded attention». Their **focus teacher**::"intellect-stack method" did not come to the hall this evening, but it doesn't mean they were absent and the created mastery of focus doesn't work as part of all these mentioned roles (focus is based on transdiscipline, it is fundamental, «everywhere», on the other side of applied disciplines).

A systemic thinker's view sees the following in the case of agents:

-   **Methods of work**, performed by **roles**. If some agent exists and does something, it means they perform work according to some method — the question is only what this method is. Most often, this is the method of creating some types of systems, if we talk about the universal agent as a creator/constructor/«enabling system». Creating and developing a system means changing the states of some objects of the physical world so that they eventually become some system (and for this also working with system descriptions). This state change is done according to some behavior pattern, which we call the method/way/practice/culture/style/work. The functional part of the agent that performs work according to this method is what we call a role. **This is the time consideration of role work.**
-   **Creator of mastery** for performing work not anyhow, but by the selected method. The key question to an agent doing work according to some method is: "where did you learn this, who taught you?" (at the same time, the agent themselves might not realize that they are «just working», but «working by a method, the method for this work, i.e., for obtaining expected results, may be different». The one who «taught the method» might be the same agent performing the work, they «self-taught». Self-learning of an agent (let’s call their role in learning::method — «student») by books, articles, courses (halfway taught by the method author, halfway by the agent growing their own method work mastery, not ad hoc), might considerably involve a separate teacher (live or AI, or a whole group of teachers, with a long chain of mastery creation — these teachers also must be created by someone) along with the student’s efforts (they will just be less «self-teacher»). In the case of agents with sufficient intelligence, usually, they speak not «creation and development», but «education»/«development» (for creating an agent usually occurs within completely different projects: you usually don't «create» a personality, but only «develop» it). For peculiarities of mastery creation, see the course「Personality Engineering」. **This is mastery creation time consideration for role performance.**

**Key points:**

-   **All roles of different system levels of the agent work simultaneously. Muscle work in organism parts, as seen by the physiologist, muscle tape work** **of the mover/body practitioner, and so on —** **including self-dancing::«culture/practice/movement method»** **of the dancer::role, performance of salsa by salsero, the dance showcase/performance of the artist at the event —** **all this** **happens simultaneously. All these various** **activities/practices/ways/methods** **of body and mind** **of the dancing couple** **and each partner individually** **we distinguish in** **the physical world** **exclusively with our own attention: something is pulled out from the background and becomes a figure, while everything else becomes** **the background.**
-   **Different labor roles** **of creators (time of mastery creation for salsa dancing —** **all these physiologists, coaches, style gurus), different** **project** **roles of salsero (working simultaneously during** **dancing —** **body practitioner, mover, style dancer)** **focus on different things** **and** **they themselves can work** **at different times, while it is the time of creating the corresponding mastery for some partial role. The creators (in the case of mastery —** **these are teachers, in the general case —** **engineers)** **highlight** **in the working system** **different objects from the background** **with their attention. All creators** **can look at their created and developed systems,** **without** **interrupting** **the operation of these systems「dismantling them」, and they can act simultaneously. In the case of dancing —** **all doctors and trainers (body engineers) and teachers (personality engineers) see** **each their own (results of the corresponding systems' work of the organism and results of the corresponding mastery work) in the dancing couple.**
