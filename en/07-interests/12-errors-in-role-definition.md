title: Mistakes in Defining Roles
---

“If you read ‘buffalo’ on the elephant’s cage, don’t trust your eyes”^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozma_Prutkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozma_Prutkov)].
This aphorism by Kozma Prutkov is fully applicable to project roles: we
should identify them by words and actions, not by official job titles. Sometimes titles do match
project roles, but often they do not. An agent with the title “programmer,” for example, may turn out to be a technical writer for user manuals and not know how to program at all. The same goes for self-identifications; they can also be misleading. Only actions, only discussion of the subject area of a certain method of work
(activity, culture, practice—there are countless synonyms) in conversation.

If Prince Hamlet suddenly starts asking, “Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?”, he is no longer Prince Hamlet! That is Vasily Pupkin, who has switched to another role (which one? That’s where your outlook matters! You might miss the moment when you are clearly told that someone is about to be strangled!).

In the moment of the unexpected role switch of the performer/actor, it is helpful to ask why they have changed the “subject of interest”/theme and became a different role: you may learn many interesting details. It most likely means that a new interest has emerged: the actor in your team, Vasya Pupkin, performing the previous role, remembered something important and thus switched roles, showing interest in another role. Do not forget to ask about the reason for the change of theme/“subject of interest”/“important discussed characteristic” when “people or AI”::agents suddenly change roles during conversation. The positions of these agents don’t matter, except they might indicate the administrative authority of the conversation participants. Position only matters when giving orders and determining rates; it does not affect thinking and activities!

Nevertheless, we remember that “they meet by clothes,” and the role is often deduced from the position. Therefore, we recommend naming yourself as close to the real role as possible. Call yourself an “analyst”—and you will be talked to as a person who decides nothing, just “makes suggestions to the boss.” Call yourself an “engineer”—you will be talked to as someone who makes decisions themselves, not just suggests them to someone else.

**We remind you of the main mistakes made by people in defining ** **external and internal (team) roles for the project. If a student makes these mistakes (because they are clearly spelled out here), they can boldly count on two points on the exam. If these mistakes are made by someone other than a student, life will give them those two points:**

- Instead of a role, they indicate a performer—a specific person or specific department (name or department/organizational unit), or even AI.
- Instead of a role, they indicate a “responsible one” (position, organizational unit, position in staffing), most often the “boss” (error like “Theater Director” in the cast list of “A Midsummer Night's Dream”). It is easily recognized by the qualifiers “lead,” “chief,” “manager”: these words in the role name should be very alarming).
- They indicate a rank (academic degree, military rank) instead of a role, attempts to indicate the level of skill but not the type of skill itself.
- They indicate the type of organization, which has many different roles (clinic, factory). Indicating “clinic” for a medical project—what work methods does the clinic deal with, what important characteristics and preferences does this “super role” have? Inside there are many people, executing various work methods in various roles, and among them, there will surely be different preferences for the same characteristics of the same system, you can't mix them into one whole! Indicate roles in large organizations in detail, the closer to narrow professional roles, the better!
- They assume that one agent-executor of a role means one role. No, one performer/actor can perform ten roles, whether we're talking about a person, AI, or an entire organization. One role can be performed by a large department or even many thousands of people (say, the role “player” in a game with two million players) or a complex network of many AI agents.
- They think that five external roles in the project are more than enough. No, usually the count starts from fifteen. If only five external roles are identified, it means you haven’t thought enough.
- They forget to account for their own roles and interests. But you—the agent—are also a participant in the project! What are you doing there, what are you achieving (interests), what have you learned for this, do you have a high level of expertise in performing work by what method?
- They forget about the multitude of subjects of interest in the project role and the multitude of project roles having one subject of interest. And preferences in one important characteristic/subject of interest for these roles might be different. And the ways to realize preferences are very different: three actors/performers of the doctor role will inquire about blood pressure and even agree that it needs to be urgently lowered, and then they will offer three completely different ways of lowering it! The saying about “two lawyers, three opinions” is just about this.
- They do not pay attention to the interest shown in the current situation, indicating a presumed interest from some past or expected situations. No two projects are the same, always clarify what is happening in your project, and right now (because the project situation usually changes quickly: people are active!).
- They do not distinguish between role interests, the interests/preferences themselves, not expecting the inevitable actions of agents to realize their intentions in achieving the interests of their roles.

To understand the roles in the project, you can recommend filling out a table of roughly this content. Here’s an example of filling out such a table for the simplest meeting of three from the development department:

This table is specifically designed to prompt questions that could be overlooked without it: so you don’t confuse role and position, to think about the method of work, and to pay attention to the actors’ skill in performing specific roles. Managing attention to roles, subjects of interest, interests, methods of realizing interests during the meeting is an example of methodological (about work methods) thinking, a small part of it. Without this, there will be no systemic thinking, because “the system is in the eyes of the beholder,” and the beholder here will be the role.

Who else needed to be invited to the meeting to fully discuss these subjects of interest? To answer this question, you first need to think about what roles might have other preferences in these important characteristics. Then assume who::agent might be the actor/performer of these roles. For example, it was possible to invite an actor in the role of a developer, who would give an estimate of the development time for each proposed feature^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_feature>] of the system: this would help the operational manager actor deal with their interest. You can improve the results of the role of usage concept developer by inviting someone more experienced instead of the current performer (after all, the skill of the current performer is “novice”). You can invite someone from the product promotion (marketing) department to better assess the MVP^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product>]. The main thing is that this simple table is filled in three minutes but helps to plan and understand the situation better. In complex cases, such tables save months of fruitless conversations of irrelevant people on unimportant topics.

**Special attention should be paid to your own roles in such tables.** Did you state your roles and interests at this meeting? Did you reveal your intentions, plans to realize your role interests? Did the meeting participants know what roles you played during the meeting if you didn’t explicitly state these roles?

Knowing the position and which organization you are from is not important here, nor what roles you can play outside the meeting. The main thing: who were you behaving like (in role)? What method/process did you use in your role? “None” and “common sense” is a very, very bad answer. So, you were not playing any role, acting arbitrarily, were not in culture, did not show style, behaved like a “savage at work.” How did you help other meeting participants communicate better with you? In this example, did you clearly state that you would use a method involving the concept of a minimal viable product? Did you declare your preference in features based on the MVP development method and provide arguments “from the MVP book” (thus giving a culturally conditioned role-based, not personal-without-role opinion)?

Did you answer the interests/preferences of other present roles in your speeches, did you show understanding of their subjects of interest and consider their plans for realizing their interests in your plans? Or did you respond to “simply people” or positions, not actors-in-role?

It is not necessary to create such a table in writing each time in full at each meeting (remember, “chatting in messengers” is also a meeting!). But initially, it will be very useful for you to “think in writing,” in this case, modeling the situation with roles documented in a table. At first, it will be difficult and time-consuming to think through. For example, each agent may have three roles, and the meeting may include a dozen people. Or there will be difficulties in identifying the AI role. How to account for the role of AI? As a role played by the service provider of this artificial intelligence (the role is played by AI, or even not the creator, but the operator of this AI, and the AI itself is their tool—like “nail driver” can be played by carpenter Vasya or carpenter Vasya’s hammer), because if something goes wrong, you will have to negotiate with the AI service provider, not the AI itself (with Vasya, not his hammer)—and not even with the “provider” role, but some sub-role, as “AI provider” can easily split into many different roles, and you will have to negotiate with only one of them, and all of them will be played by different people or even entire departments of the AI provider company.

Thinking about roles and their methods will become easier and easier; then you will do it “on the fly” and mentally. And, of course, without some
methodological/labor/practical/engineering outlook, it is impossible to fill out this table; for people without an outlook, what happens at the meeting will be a magical action by mutual persuasion of agent-participants. With the table, it becomes completely clear what the intrigue is and what can be done to improve the quality of decision-making at such meetings.
