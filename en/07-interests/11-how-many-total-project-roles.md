title: How many project roles are there
---

You need to remember a simple principle: **important** **roles** **in a project are always one more than you have identified**. Roles with their interests in relation to your system and project always exist if there is a project. And you don't "develop/invent/imagine" them. You "identify," "discover" them (discover).

If we take external roles separately, not team/internal roles, then you should begin not with two or three roles, but with about **15 (fifteen).** Remember that if five people are playing the same activity role for the project, it's still one role. Remember the "Dance of the Little Swans" from Swan Lake? There are four performers, but the culturally conditioned role of "little swan" is actually one, although there will be four performances of this role in the play. Mobile game players might number forty thousand, but they all share one role --- "player." So, the 15 external roles may indeed be performed by a large number of people. But the opposite is also true: one agent can play multiple roles, so five people in a project could actually be playing ten very different roles. A player-agent can also be a payer for the right to play and a buyer (registration of the purchase is in their name) --- even though these roles can also be played by different individuals, for example, if a child is playing, the purchase is registered to the mother, and the father pays for the game with his card.

One project manager told us that after easily identifying the first fifteen external roles, he realized where all his time was going unnoticed: **15 phone calls** **with role performers** **per day, each 10 minutes long, and 10 minutes of prep and post-call work, resulting in 5 hours simply to maintain adequate understanding** **of the current situation of reconciling their interests! And if there are project problems to solve with** **these roles, 10-minute calls are clearly insufficient.** Since no one explicitly tracked external roles in the project, this time vanished "invisibly," spent unconsciously, not reflected in plans, and the manager's resources for this work weren't allocated or accounted for. Awareness of roles and their interests, planning work with agents-in-roles to align their interests --- they are important!

So for dancing::method/culture/practice/process/activity (we taboo the word "dance" as it may mean "a type of dance"/"style of dancing," "dance performance/outcome of dancing," or "dance culture") you can separately highlight the roles^[<https://vk.com/@buffdance-rasskaz-o-sistemnyh-urovnyah-v-tance>]:

- The dancer (who, in fact, dances --- performs the "dancing"),
- sub-role "partner" (only in those types/styles of dance where they exist! In other types/styles of dance, they might not be, or conversely, there might be an ensemble/team/crew with many dancers, and for lap dance, it's not so much a "partner" as a "client." In social/partner styles, there are separate roles of leader and follower, both gender-independent^[<https://jenabl.wordpress.com/2017/05/17/inclusivity-and-dance-terminology/>]),
- the spectator (but only in dances that assume a spectator. For example, in social kizomba, a spectator is not assumed; partners in the pair dance only for each other),
- the choreographer (responsible for the composition and set of movements),
- the dance coach/teacher (teaches dancing),
- the music editor/DJ (selects music),
- the dance event organizer (party, battle/competition, concert, seminar/festival, etc.),
- often this list includes a photographer (at parties) or videographer (for concert performances and battles),
- for stage dance styles (ballet, stage dances) there will also be a costume designer,
- often a makeup artist/visagist.

And this is also not a complete list! For example, in sports dances, there are also

- judges,
- a member of the scoring committee (calculates the judges’ work results),
- an informant judge (announces the judges' results).

Of course, these are just roles, and role performers may be fewer. If I dance-improvise by myself in front of a mirror at home, then I perform many of these roles myself simultaneously or at different moments. For example, first, I will be the music editor/DJ, choosing music, and then the dancer and spectator, simultaneously doing the choreographer's work --- composing the dance performance/number/setup. Or the number of agent-role performers may be more: there are many spectators, and you can even **deepen the division of labor**, that is, split the current role set into sub-roles and distribute them to different performers: the music editor/DJ splits into the artistic director of the event (sets the music format, its stylistic direction, and checks adherence by the DJ; the term "director" here should not confuse, it doesn’t refer to a job title) and the DJ who directly implements the given musical format and stylistic direction.

**When a systemic thinker thinks about a system, and the projects related to its creation and use, they** **remember that** **the success of the system depends** **precisely on how** **the interests/preferences** **of all involved roles are taken into account.** **And** **also** **they remember that they themselves::actor** **are not a neutral** **"thinker above the fray,"** **but also play a role in the project, and they::roles** **have** **preferences/interests** **they want to realize.** **Don’t forget to take yourself into account** **as a role, and also don't forget to show** **other agents-participants of the project, which** **"position"** **you have taken!**

Often among the many synonyms for project/work/practical/organizational/engineering/cultural/strategic roles (especially external project roles) the word "stakeholder" is chosen, familiar in English literature. In English literature, they may still separately consider the agent-in-role as a stakeholder and separately recognize the existence of this person’s role as a stakeholder role, but this distinction is not universally accepted! For instance, ISO 42010:2022 states: "stakeholder: role, position, individual, organization, or classes thereof, having an interest, right, share, or claim, in an entity of interest. EXAMPLE: End users, operators, acquirers, owners, suppliers, architects, developers, builders, maintainers, regulators, taxpayers, certifying agencies, and markets". What do you think, how many people will read this as a list of roles, and how many--- as agents-in-roles, considering the definition includes "role," "position" and "agent/individual with organization (or even their classes)." How many will get confused by "market" as an example --- is it a role, position, individual, organization, or class? From the perspective of our course, this list is akin to "metal crosses, Catholic crosses." Of course, we use international standards materials in our course but urge caution and to always engage "type detector" when reading to catch ontological jitter.

We acknowledge that the term "stakeholder" (and much less often "stakeholder role") is already widespread in Russian, but we avoid using it in our course. The word "stakeholder" easily conflates role with actor/performer of the role, and even position. "Stakeholder Prince Hamlet" and "stakeholder Vasya Pupkin" sound the same to a Russian ear, and from that moment thoughts about the role quietly switch off, leaving the usual household thinking "about people" and not even as actors but as agents who, besides playing roles as individuals-actors, also as organisms eat, sleep, get sick, and go to the bathroom.

"Stakeholders" start to be perceived as "just people, as they are and for some reason sometimes organizations". With this word usage, it's easy to think these "just people" make decisions based on pettiness, bad character, mood, and not due to some role preferences. No, roles cannot be petty, they are roles, not people! Their interests --- are role interests, their decisions stem from the method of the role. If a structural engineer thinks a part in the system can't be less than 4 cm for the chosen material, and everyone else opposes it because such a decision steps on their interests, then this is not his opinion as an agent-with-a-bad-character but the opinion of the role!

If agents, roles, positions are confused --- there is no methodological (about methods/work activities, what roles are dealing with) thinking, and as a result, no systems thinking! Therefore, we recommend using role terminology, because "work/project role Prince Hamlet/engineer/salesman" sounds good, whereas "external project role Vasya Pupkin" --- the tongue does not turn to say it. And it’s good that the tongue does not turn! By not confusing agents, their roles, and positions, there will be full-fledged methodological thinking, enabling you to discuss culturally conditioned work methods, role items of interest, role interests, engage in systems thinking --- and initially negotiate with everyone (qualification "practitioner"), and subsequently have everyone around you negotiate (qualification "master").

Early versions of our course used traditional "stakeholder" terminology, and the material on roles was poorly understood. After changing the terminology to "project role" in its distinction from a person or organization, things improved, including communication with people in projects who hadn't taken the system thinking course. Additionally, the joke disappeared about the level of steak doneness for the stakeholder. **Don't talk about stakeholders, talk about roles** **(in extreme cases ---** **"stakeholder roles," if your organization can't live without the word "stakeholder")!** In the current version of the course, "person" was further replaced by "agent," because roles in the 21st century are not always performed by humans, and not all decisions in a group of people are made by humans; smart sensible "non-living entities"/AI have appeared (and it can't be said they are just "interface modules to humans," so too can be said about a human secretary --- "an interface module to the human boss").

If we speak not about a "role in the work method"/"project role," but just about practitioner/worker/dealer/engineer --- this is quite possible, but there may be confusion akin to that with stakeholder:

- whether we call the person::agent "practitioner" or "dealer" without regard to their role,
- or indicating the agent's role, although not specifying which one.

In such cases, it's better to clarify. In our course, a similar range of synonyms has been provided several times; usually, we refer to the actor-in-some-role. However, there is a high probability the role aspect will not be picked up, and it would just be an "epithet" for a specific agent: "practitioner Vasya" will mean not that Vasya is performing some specific subject-specific method (e.g., pasting posters on fences, and now he is not Vasya but "poster sticker," or "Vasya::actor practicing poster sticking," "Vasya::actor/practitioner poster sticking"). For those unfamiliar with the concept of the work method and the role practicing this method, it will be just an indication of Vasya himself, similar to "mister" or "sir." "Practitioner Vasya," "dealer Vasya" sound good.

Unfortunately, light solutions and universally understood terms won’t exist, all words have long been taken. Therefore, better talk about roles, it is more reliable, but we will also speak of "dealer," "practitioner," "actor," "engineer," and even "worker," meaning the actor-in-role performing work by some method, working in some culture, in some style, performing practice/activity/"type of work"/"type of engineering"/"method of work" or even strategy (as a target method chosen during strategizing::method). All these are synonyms with slight nuances.
