title: Do Not Conflate Critical Characteristics and Preferences
---

The word "interest" in English is "interest," meaning a "commercial interest," "what we are interested in regarding the project." In systems thinking, "interest" is historically referred to by another word: **concern**^[Stakeholders have interests in a System; those interests are called Concerns --- <http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/cm/>], which in a more precise Russian translation sounds like "**concern:** **a critical attribute of the system, an object of interest in the system.**" Objects of interest are the characteristics of the system that various roles in the project continuously pay attention to. These are not role-based desires for where to steer the object of interest. The object of interest of many roles and the interest/preference of a role ("role-based desire to steer the object of interest") are different. The object of interest, a characteristic, is not "higher price" but "price." However, the interest/preference is precisely "higher price," where to steer the object of interest! For price, there could also be another preference: lower price, but "object of interest"/"key characteristic" will remain the same—price.

Project roles, both external and team roles, continuously pose various questions about their objects of interest. ISO 42010:2022 provides an example of such questions (remember that this is a standard for documenting architectural descriptions, but all other descriptions will respond to similarly formulated questions, though their objects might be entirely different):

- How is the system maintained?
- What system behavior is critical for safety?
- Can the target system comply with mandatory national standards?
- What is the operating cost?
- What risks, opportunities, satisfaction, survivability, coherence, resource availability, complexity, and trust does this architecture offer?
- What is the transparency of distribution described in the reference model of open distributed processing^[<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-transparency-in-distributed-system/>]?

The project team describes the target system and its environment, as well as the creator systems in their complex graph, so that both the project team roles and external project roles have clear answers to these questions. Additionally, all roles involved in the discussion undertake actions to realize their preferences regarding the interests (sometimes actors, to achieve the preferences of some of their roles, include executing methods of other roles; remember that agents can exhibit significant creativity).

Roles are truly concerned with some object, and in their thinking, these work/activity "concerns" dominate; they act based on the intent to realize their preferences in target characteristics. A seller will try to raise the price, a buyer—to lower the price.

Each work role, depending on its function/type of work, has one or more interests (objects of interest with preferences in them)—it is quite possible that different project roles/stakeholders have the same objects of interest and the same or different preferences in them. This is very convenient: even if one role has two-three-five objects of interest, the overall list of these system characteristics will not be two to five times longer than the list of project roles; it will be much shorter. **If it is necessary to prepare some materials/descriptions/models for negotiating preferences in interests, their number will be proportional to the number of** **critical characteristics**, **not the number of preferences, nor the number of project roles.** **And further, the preferences** **of a large number of roles** **will be negotiated using a few descriptions reflecting a small number of objects of interest.**

The schematic diagram of an electric scooter as a description reflecting some of its critical characteristics will be used by many roles: those advocating for increasing::preference its power::characteristic, those advocating for limited::preference power consumption::characteristic, those advocating for maximum::preference acceleration speed::characteristic, and those concerned about its charging speed. This description/model allows for negotiating multiple preferences for various characteristics of the electric scooter as objects of interest to both external and team roles in the electric scooter creation project.

When the objects of interest/important characteristics for roles are the same, **preferences** in the value of these characteristics for different internal/team and external roles can vary significantly. If you encounter roles such as "safety officer" and "seller," their object of interest in the electric scooter will surely be "maximum speed," but their preferences/interest evaluations will differ: one needs to lower the maximum speed for maximum safety, while the other needs to raise it as much as possible to convince buyers and have an advantage over competitors' scooters. Naturally, it is not always necessary to have pairs of roles with such different preferences for one interest, but such pairs occur quite frequently, and not only regarding the interest of "cost" or "maximum speed."

Negotiations over the values of critical characteristics (sometimes called **production conflict**) occur with any objects of interest. For instance, the "weight of the electric scooter"::characteristic has the preference "lighter" for the consumer, while for the designer, the interest might be "heavier weight" to place a more capacious battery or use a stronger, and thus heavier, construction. The designer acknowledges that "heavier weight" is bad, but for them, it is a "necessary evil," beneficial for them! If the decision is left to the designer, the scooter might become excessively heavy for the consumer, even though it might look great in many other characteristics. It is better for the consumer's interest in weight::characteristic to be defended by a marketer/seller as a team member rather than the designer making the "balanced decision."

Remember, if both project roles with conflicting preferences for one characteristic are played by one actor/role performer, and the production conflict occurs in one head, this is called a **conflict of interest**^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest>]. It is useful to segregate the conflict of interest among different people::actors because in a productive production conflict, the roles control each other's mistakes, but when this mistake control occurs in one head, it becomes difficult: an actor might prefer one role's solution even if it's erroneous. By segregating the conflict of interest into roles for different actors, the discussion of preferences within one object of interest is public, and errors in reasoning might be found by some third parties, who can also provide proposals for resolving the production conflict. Decision-making can be documented and reviewed by independent experts. Thus, in the absence of a conflict of interest (production conflict within one actor's head) and translating the conflict of interest into a production/productive conflict, more quality agreements on preferences within the production conflict across different heads of different actors can be made, fewer mistakes will occur, various role preferences will be considered more qualitatively, and the system will be more successful.

But if trying to segregate all identified conflicts of interest among different heads (whether people or even divisions) literally, nothing will work out: the number of conflicts of interest is enormous, and even considering that one head can participate in many conflicts of interest, you still need to ensure that roles engaged in intensive negotiations are organizationally closer to each other—the negotiations are not everybody with everybody, but within some org-units (this will be discussed later: good modularity is important for both target systems/products and creator organizations), hence ideally—within one agent's head.

But if simply assuming that we will then increase the number of heads in the division (roughly—instead of one person, we will place two to separate the conflict of interest, a classic example—separating the roles of cashier and ticket seller), it will not only become more expensive but also slow down the work in large projects. The more heads in a project, the less time will be spent on work (decision-making, "choosing from different alternatives in one head") and the more on endless negotiations over conflicts, thereby drastically slowing down the project according to Amdahl's law^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law>] (increasing the number of processors/heads for speeding up work cannot be done infinitely, as more and more time will be spent not on the actual work, but on dividing the work, then coordinating, then collecting the results, eventually productivity per worker/processor drops significantly). Be cautious with increasing the number of workers and slowing down work, as this also applies in the case of an "infinite number of workers obtained from AI agents."

However, if a "goat guarding the vegetable plot" is found, it is better to allocate the functions of guarding the plot and eating the cabbage to different workers. Though the process might be slightly slower, failing to do so will result in quick and highly predictable outcomes, often involving unforeseen additional expenses on the cabbage.

Conflicts of interest could be in one head or entire communities. Not addressing Big Pharma's vested interests in selling medications that do not cure patients but are taken indefinitely to relieve symptoms or the conflict of interest among doctors appointing unnecessary procedures, let's consider an industrial example—the Phoebus Cartel.

In May 2022, the USA announced (attention! The agent who did this is missing! Did you notice the impersonal sentence? What role typically carries out such "announcements" and what does it signify? Identify impersonal sentences! They lack roles and actors, making them hard to work with further!) a bill banning (again, the object is missing: who::role will ban whom::role) the sale of incandescent lamps (there it is: the system type we're dealing with, substance level, even below the level of a cyber-physical system). This is done (by whom?! Role again missing!) to stimulate the transition to LED lamps (whom are we stimulating? Who benefits? But this is clearly an expression of intent). In this context, Bloomberg's article authors (here they act as critics of the proposed regulation: critics of the social engineers advocating for banning incandescent lamps) discuss the story of the Phoebus Cartel (Phoebus, also Apollo - light’s god)^[<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-04/cheering-for-led-bulbs-read-this-cautionary-tale-about-the-phoebus-cartel>].

There was social engineering at the community level. Competition among tungsten filament incandescent lamp manufacturers quickly led to nearly eternal lamps (lamp lifespan::critical characteristic/object of interest). A conflict of interests is evident: manufacturers benefit when lamps burn out quickly::preference (they will be bought forever!), and when they last long::preference (they will be bought from those who make them that way). Thus, social engineering was undertaken among manufacturers: they organized a cartel::"organizational system" which, with great effort (remember, in a conflict of interest, forces simultaneously pull towards different preferences—and hence there are always forces inducing cartel formation and forces leading to cartel dissolution; thus, the saying "cartels work, cartels don't last long") forced all manufacturers to make tungsten-filament incandescent lamps not burning out before 1000 hours but eventually burning out after. A "1000 Hours Life Committee" was established, creating a Swiss laboratory to check lamp batches for "appropriate burnout." If lamps burned out prematurely, the market eliminated them (buyers are smart! they don't buy bad products!), but if they burned out later—the cartel fined it. If lamp samples from a batch burned without burnout between 800 and 1750 hours, the manufacturer could sell the rest without a fine. But if the lamps managed to last from 1750 to 2000 hours, the responsible company had to pay a fine of 20 Swiss francs per thousand sold lamps. Fines increased as lamps lasted longer: if a lamp lasted 3000 hours, it cost the manufacturer 200 francs per thousand lamps sold. The system worked: before the cartel, lamps lasted on average 2500 hours without burning out; a decade later, the Phoebus Cartel reduced this figure to 1200 hours.

The article authors query how the intention to ban incandescent lamps' sale (still burning out at roughly 1200 hours without the cartel) matches different roles' interests and what opposing social engineering might ensue: during the switch to LED lamps, it is claimed they are nearly perpetual (just like incandescent lamps at the Phoebus Cartel formation). The authors ponder: once legislative prohibition of competing, still-burning-out incandescent lamps occurs, won't LED lamp lifetime slip from "nearly perpetual" to the usual 1200 hours? After all, the situation with LED lamps and the purity of their manufacturers' intentions (frustration from the consumer's desire for a perpetual lamp and manufacturers' desire to limit lamp lifespan) is exactly the same, while the competitive advantage in durability over incandescent lamps need not be shown; regular incandescent lamps won't be on sale. Remaining LED lamp manufacturers would collude: perpetual LEDs would burden these manufacturers, so they'd produce burnout-prone ones.

Of course, the article doesn't discuss antitrust laws (by whom? Article authors! Catch the impersonal sentences!) as they are about price collusion, not lamp lifespan! Social engineering is interesting as all these "social engineers" work oppositely, competitively. Cartels inevitably appear and dissolve, but in techno-evolution, some discoveries succeed despite being disliked or irrational, surviving with numerous variations at similar costs (manifestation of frustrations due to attempts to resolve conflicts across systemic levels). This is physics^[<https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/434505/Konflikty_kak_osnova_slozhnosti>, scientific article in <https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1807890115>], explaining the rise in possible nearly identically quasi-optimal configurations of various systems and the general increase in system complexity (growth in systemic levels) during evolution: solving lower-level problems influences higher levels, and vice versa: project optimizations must be multi-level.

Examples like the Phoebus consortium show that **one can indeed decipher situations at a higher organizational/project level (community,** **society, and even "agency," as agents aren't always humans nowadays). Utilizing a methodological concept set** **comprising "agent," "actor** **as** **role-performing agent," "role," "object of interest/critical system characteristic or** **the creating and developing** **project," "interest/preference," "intention," "strategy"::method, "work** **plan,"** **should suffice for thorough analysis of varied situations relating to agents' behavior, sometimes demonstrating highly** **"rational."**
