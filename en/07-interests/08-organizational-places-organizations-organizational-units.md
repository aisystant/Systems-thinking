title: Organizational Places, Organizations, Org Units

To clarify who manages the organization's resources (premises, equipment, and especially the labor of other people), organizations introduce a structure of responsibility: some people are superiors to others. But, of course, it is better to think of them as agents, and in the case of legal "supervision" - "persons". For example, you cannot fire an agent (a person) holding the position of "CEO of a joint-stock company," even if you own the controlling stake. You need to convene a general meeting that will elect a new CEO. But you can appoint your organization to the position of "CEO of a joint-stock company" through this same shareholders' meeting. The CEO in a joint-stock company is called a "sole executive body," but no one said that it must be a physical/human person! So, you appoint your organization as the CEO of the joint-stock company, and then inform the employees of the joint-stock company that your junior janitor Vasya Pupkin will be performing the role of CEO on behalf of your organization - Vasya Pupkin presents your order to the employees of the JSC and begins to perform his official duties as a junior janitor of your organization, i.e., the work as the CEO of the joint-stock company.

Why so complicated? If you need to replace Vasya Pupkin with someone like Dasha Mirkina, you can do it at two in the morning by issuing your own order within your organization. Then Dasha Mirkina arrives at the joint-stock company at three in the morning and announces that they now need to follow her orders instead of Vasya Pupkin's orders since she is now the sole executive body of the joint-stock company, the CEO. And Vasya Pupkin? Well, he continues to work in your organization. The advantage is that you can replace the CEO of the joint-stock company in a few minutes, instead of going through the months-long procedure of convening a general shareholders' meeting. This is a perfectly functional scheme. At one time, RAO "UES of Russia" managed the activities of its regional energy companies in this way, which were also joint-stock companies but subsidiaries and dependent. If any of the directors disagreed with the opinion of the managing company, they would be removed from their position in a few hours, not months that it takes to organize an extraordinary shareholders' meeting, even if you have 100% of the shares.

So remember: positions are not about roles, and not even about people. These are organizational places where various agents work, performing various roles. And it's about appointments and dismissals first of all, and then about subordination in terms of delegating tasks. And that's all, if we don't consider the fact that a position title doesn't cost anything, but to the person bearing a position title, it might be pleasant. Say, a small enterprise "Empire," the sole executive body - not a CEO, but an "emperor." Zero cost if you are the owner of the enterprise, but to the bearer of the title "emperor," it might be pleasant.

**Organization** (organization) - is an organized (i.e., with clear authorities and responsibilities for managing labor and capital) group of agents with buildings, structures, equipment, consumables, raw materials, financial resources, etc., at their disposal. But the main thing is the management of resources: the principle of known responsibility for all organized agents about who::agent-in-orgplace/position can ask whom::agent-in-orgplace/position for something::task-in-practice, and this request must be fulfilled, and refusal leads to investigations and may serve as grounds for dismissal.

In organizations, **organizational places/positions/vacancies** are introduced (sometimes referred to as positions in the staffing table - not to be confused with role positions from the previous section!). The structure of positions/org places defines not the role structure, but the structure of subordination, accountability, the possibility to ask someone for something, to pay someone for something, to prevent someone from doing something, to allow someone to do something. In the theater, these are actors responsible for playing certain roles assigned to them later. First, Vasily Pupkin is hired for the position of an actor, thereby obtaining authority to play roles in performances, and later the actor is assigned the role of Prince Hamlet in daytime performances and also the role of Othello in evening performances (and the actor in the position plays two roles), later Vasily Pupkin is dismissed, and Pyotr Sidorov is hired for his position (after dismissal, it is vacant - organizational place), and these roles of Prince Hamlet and Othello are played by Pyotr Sidorov.

People-in-position and people-in-role are different things. People-in-position are about subordination-accountability, including "promise to perform work" and "actual performance of work," people-in-role are about the method of work. From the position, you usually cannot understand the method people in this position work, although position titles may very much resemble role names, you would not immediately understand what it is about. The position of "programmer" may be occupied by Bohdan, who performs the role of a technical writer of English documentation, improves in the methods of technical writing, and considers writing programs in programming languages boring for him, and thinks that he will never again work in the role (but not the position, the position in this regard does not concern him - it is about salary and name, not the content of the work) of a programmer.

Employees in the organization cannot be asked to do everything, but if you ask an employee for action according to the expected role in the project, the request will be fulfilled. The essence here is that positions and roles do not depend on each other: they are assigned separately, often multiple roles are assigned to be executed by agents-in-positions/organizational places, and then the agent gets to this position and is henceforth expected to perform all roles assigned to this position. If the position of "chief mountaineer" is associated with the roles of "speleologist," "chemical analyst," "helicopter pilot," then replacing Pavel Andreevich with Ilya Nikanorovich in this position means that Ilya Nikanorovich begins to perform work according to the methods of speleology, chemical analysis and helicopter flights (and from him, accordingly, mastery of these methods is expected). At the same time, it is absolutely clear (from the structure of subordination) who will be the boss of the "chief mountaineer," and thus - the boss of the agent who will occupy the position/organizational place.

It is necessary to clearly delineate:

- Positions - these are about requests and obligations (hence "position," but often also "place") in their execution of work attached to the roles. About the work roles (associated with the cost of resources working with instances of certain objects, for which authorities are needed), but not the methods/functions/ways/cultures of work (for which mastery is needed).
- Roles - primarily about work methods, professional competence/qualification/"degree of mastery" in performing work by the method of this role by the agent who will play the role (occupy the position to which the role is attached), role/labor/activity crucial characteristics of some systems affected by the work methods of the role (objects of interest) and preferences in the values of these important characteristics (interests).

With people, everything is complicated if we say that positions are primarily about resources, that is, also the concept of "rate" which means the standard duration of paid work in this position per period (most often per month, but sometimes per week or even day, or even hour - then they speak of a weekly rate, daily rate, or hourly rate, say, $300 per hour may be an hourly rate for a lecturer at a foreign university). "Work one and a half rate" - this usually means spending one and a half times more time than usual for the specified position, receiving one and a half times more payment. It is possible, of course, to occupy several positions at once ("sitting on two chairs at once" - remember, position and organizational place are synonyms).

A vacancy/position/organizational place filled by a person gives us an **org unit/organizational unit**. The minimum org unit/organizational unit consists of one person, and if we are talking about "half-rate" (and in universities, to grant some formal authority to lecture but not to pay a salary, sometimes 1/8 rate is given), then it is not "half-person," but "one full person, but in terms of performing work, half the usual weekly duration of work can be expected, for all the roles assigned to the position."

Org units can be merged, forming both **departments** (permanently functioning organizational units) and **collegial bodies** (temporary, convening only occasionally councils, commissions, working groups), as well as **project groups** engaged in achieving some result.

**Usually, collegial bodies and project groups are not listed in staffing tables** **(vacancy lists)** **just to emphasize their relative autonomy in subordination, as well as the non-standard** **way of remuneration** - though this does not mean that no one has the right to assign them tasks, requiring the performance of certain activities and expecting them to show role interests/preferences, and also that compensation will not be paid for work within such an org unit. But to reiterate: the subordination/leadership relationship is separate from the role/subject/professional attitude to activity.

The minimum org unit consists of a performer, viewed simultaneously as:

- **agent-in-position** (and this means that their accountability/subordination and rights for managing/directing the labor and property of other organizational units are clear, as well as how their work is paid for). **Along this line works positional subordination,** **management, leadership. This is the line of the constructive organization design.**
- **agent-in-role** (and this means that their method of work is understood, there are expectations of their professional mastery in the method of this role, it is clear their objects of interest and the interests themselves, and therefore it is possible to build expectations about their actions in the role). Along this line works professional/functional oversight, governance (this translates as "supervision," "oversight," but not "management") and it is not customary to talk about subordination. But if adherence to the method along this line is performed poorly, the agent will be removed from the position - and no boss can help them.

And it would be good to understand that the language of this conversation about organization (when it is clear who can assign tasks to whom and why these assignments will be fulfilled) is not very applicable for conversations at the level of communities, societies, and humanity in general: in communities, it is not clear who can assign what to whom, if there are assignments, they are carried out voluntarily. In societies, an organization (state) can exist which treats its citizens as almost property, and fulfilling assignments there is usually associated with extortion: direct threat of violence if assignments are refused. If you are assigned to come to the draft board and you don't want to - you have no option to "resign." If you are assigned to pay 13% of your income, there is no option not to fulfill the assignment, and resigning is also not so simple, "pay your taxes and sleep well" is no different from extortion, if you disobey, force will be applied to you, which will not happen in business or communities.

Therefore, be careful in using recommendations from our course at these levels: communities and societies. Systems thinking, of course, is quite applicable at these levels, but it’s not a fact that you will immediately be successful in this application. Systems thinkers have not yet worked out these levels well enough in terms of quick-thinking methods about them and reliably working engineering methods for creating and developing societies and communities to quickly and effectively teach you to work with communities and societies. And always remember, if you want to do something with communities and societies, then every person there (and AI agent) does not dream of being managed by you, and vice versa - would be happy to manage you if they had the opportunity. Therefore, such projects are most often utopian. Yes, some people become presidents and prime ministers and somehow influence the lives of millions of people, but think about the percentage of these elites from the Earth's total population and estimate the likelihood that you will find yourself in this number in your lifetime. Do not engage in utopian projects, do not waste time on them. You can very well improve the lives of millions and millions of people without having them under direct subordination - neither positional nor in terms of state power.
