title: Position
---

When a performer holds onto a particular role for a long time, sometimes acting according to the interests of that role even in situations where other roles and the pursuit of other interests are expected from him (i.e., the objects of interest and preferences of this role come first in any roles in the corresponding method of work), this is called --- **position** (a concept of system-activity methodologists^[[http://praxos.ru/index.php/СМД-методология](http://praxos.ru/index.php/СМД-методология)], it is almost equivalent to the concept of methodological/project/activity/organizational role, but has its peculiarities). However, we do not confuse **"1.** **position"** as a term for reliably maintaining a role (conscious or unconscious) and another dictionary meaning--- **"2.** **position" as a position in an organization. We are not discussing the job title; we continue discussing roles.**

When an agent-actor not only plays a role but also occupies the role position of "manager", their managerial values/preferences in certain important characteristics for their role begin to manifest both when they organize engineers in a work project, and when they raise children, and when they sit in Parliament. When this actor is in the position of "parent", their educational (for instance, instilling some moral guidelines in others) interests/important characteristics and preferences/values are present both at home among children, and in the work collective, and at a noisy party.

Positions are most often occupied unconsciously (and thus it is easy to manipulate such **positioners** as agents who have taken a position: any of their actions are easily predictable, as they no longer act by themselves, their role/functional position and its values are quite predictable, and they cannot change it, cannot exit the role). The reaction of a performer of such a "stuck functional role" to a direct indication of their unconsciously occupied position can vary: "Seems like I'm stuck in this role, thank you for pointing it out" or on the contrary "What position? How do my roles not change in different matters? I'm so spontaneous and diverse, which I am proud of!"

But long-term presence in a role by an agent can be intentional and conscious --- deliberate focus on the interests of the role, focus, "holding a position". If this is "unconscious focus", then it is more likely "distraction" (loss of control over one's attention), "unconscious role sticking", "unconscious position holding". In any case, **position ---** **is prolonged** **and clear** **role holding, deliberate or not.**

**It's important to note the term
project/functional/activity role itself:** **"project role"**
**means a role in some project, but the role itself is taken not from the project,
but from some culturally conditioned** **(often associated with** **"profession",** **although here it’s simply about** **qualification in some skill)** **work method. Activity role ---** **is a role in activity/ "type of labor", these are all synonyms with slight meaning nuances, but these are all references to the well-known division of labor.**
The role of "carpenter" is not taken from the project of "building a doghouse", but from human culture, it is a functional role --- but in the project of building a doghouse it will be a project role! To avoid confusion, you can always check: if both these roles are played by the same physically existing Stepan Nikanorovich at the same time, then we are talking about the same role --- just different names emphasize different aspects of this role: the project where this role is involved and the activity in which this role is defined.

It can be supplemented with a number of synonyms:
**methodological/project/functional/activity/practical/labor/cultural/organizational/engineering**
**role**. If you want to emphasize that you adhere to systems engineering as a normative method, then it will be **an engineering role** --- and even some "politician" here will be in an engineering role (social engineer). If these roles are held for a long time by someone --- they will not be roles anymore, but
methodological/project/activity/practical/labor/engineering/cultural/organizational
positions.

Occupying a position is more related to "work method"/"type of activity"/"type of labor"/"type of engineering"/"type of subculture"
(sometimes they talk about the work method as a whole, activity as a whole, labor as a whole, but sometimes they emphasize that usually, only part of all possible
work methods/activities/labor/engineering/practices of one role is used, then they simply insert "type" or "variant" --- "variant of the method", "type of labor", "type of culture" or even "variant of subculture" to emphasize the applicability of reasoning for some variety of the method), but less related to the project. A person who has taken a position will usually occupy it consciously and unconsciously not in one project, but in many projects --- it is something like "choosing a profession" (conscious choice), or "discovering oneself in a profession" (unconscious choice), rather than purely situational choice "in the project of creating a specific system". An agent in the role of "carpenter" --- he will be a "project carpenter" in all projects if he holds the position, but we will call his position in this case an activity/labor position, not a project one. This is, of course, because a role is chosen and a position is occupied not just any role, but only that for which the agent has the skills to perform the work methods. If you want to take the role of a hairdresser or thermal engineer, without skills in hair-cutting methods or heat exchanger engineering methods, this will not be possible.

You can and should occupy a position consciously: "now I will strategically take such and such a position", that is, "choose a clear role for myself in a clear play/activity/practice/game/culture, and keep my attention on the objects of interest and preferences of this role in the most varied projects until I change my mind and independently clearly exit this role” (and somewhere nearby there will be training in the skill of performing the work method of the chosen role). Strategic --- means that during the strategy-making a decision was made to adhere to some work method and keep it in attention (for details on strategy-making as the choice of work method, see the course "Systems Management", there are two sections dedicated to strategy-making, and it turns out to be equally applicable to agent-people and agent-organizations).

The conscious choice of a role/position by an agent (e.g., a person) during strategy-making is usually called
**self-determination**^[<https://shchedrovitskiy.com/nabroski-k-bazovoy-sheme-samoopredeleniya-1/>]
and is highly valued: **you become predictable in your behavior to people with** **labor** **horizon. They understand how to cooperate with you, what you can do, and what you will not do. Self-determination significantly facilitates entry into various projects, improves teamwork.** **Remember that it’s not enough to just self-determine, you also need the skill to perform the method of the occupied position, and also focus to hold this position during the project.**

When a performer jumps from one role to another in a single project like a rabbit, it is very difficult to negotiate with them: the external effect is such that they constantly change their objects of interest and preferences in characteristics --- what was valuable to them in their previous role five minutes ago suddenly ceases to be significant, but instead, new claims arise to the already agreed values of characteristics. **A person without explicitly presented roles and role preferences** **can be called** **"such a flexible person, no one can catch them",** **or** **(and** **most often it is called that way!) ---** **"such a slippery person".** **Therefore, it is better to be focused and attempt to occupy a position, rather than just "playing roles" one per second.**

People as actors relatively rarely consciously and intentionally avoid clearly occupying a position, then performing tasks within a clearly understandable method, consciously becoming unpredictable so that their role objects/zones/areas of interest remain hidden, intentions and strategies (methods/ways of work) of them as agents are unclear, and therefore actions resulting from them cannot be calculated. No, in such cases people::actors are simply poorly oriented in their roles, do not realize them (do not know that games by role, and not “general active participation” in the project are expected from them), they have no "intentional avoidance of holding a role", but their attention wanders over various objects of discussion, they lack focus, and they themselves do not notice this.

Sometimes the need for role-playing by actors is realized, but they simply do not have the skills necessary to perform their role: they poorly know the role, are unfamiliar with the labor culture, i.e., they have not read textbooks and did not receive other education; they lack experience in role-playing, as they do not accumulate time in the role; lack labor horizon and therefore do not understand what to negotiate with actors playing other roles in this project.

Unfocused people will unstably hold a position, unstably reproduce role behavior --- and this will be a problem for the project. A functional/professional/activity/labor/project/engineering/practical/methodological/organizational/cultural role can change in a person even during the utterance of one phrase --- the beginning of the phrase will be, for example, from the role of Prince Hamlet or operational manager, and the end of the phrase from the role of Othello or a grabber wanting to grab a bonus to their salary.

Jumps between roles are possible to roles from completely different plays or games (like in the case of Prince Hamlet and Othello, operational manager and grabber) --- and yes, this may be a manifestation of a conflict of interest. Or suddenly emerges the role of a party functionary who decided to carry out the policy of their political party right in the workplace. A systems thinker should track such situations and use leadership methods (in theater this is done by the director towards the actors), helping role performers to get comfortable with their roles and focusing them on performing role work in the project, not just arbitrary "life in the project".

Many people are perceived as reliable (and really are) because "holding their role"/"occupying a position" happens to them already automatically, as a habit of their thinking. They automatically adhere to a "set of values" (i.e., interests, preferences in values of important characteristics, we rarely consciously use the word "values" because everyone understands it differently and it is confusing, sometimes it means value/use, not "values of important characteristics", sometimes it is about morality) of their role, in which they are stuck, values of work methods they have long been engaged in. Therefore, they look like principled people, upholding some of their principles. But if they do not have their own business/activity/work methods and performing these work methods position/role, then they just as unconsciously "do not hold a position", and look slippery and unprincipled: they are never "Prince Hamlets", they are always Vasya Pupkins, it is impossible to play role games for multiple roles with them, i.e., participate in the division of labor (work of different agents by different work methods, in which they have different skills). And there are no projects without division of labor today.

People (we are mainly talking about people here, not about AI or organizations) who are aware of performing their (professional, social, family) roles can choose --- to occupy any positions for a long time or on the contrary, to part with occupied positions when there is no longer a need for them. People who realize others' roles can often understand the objects of interest and role preferences/motives/values of certain actions and statements of people, precisely because they think not about the people themselves, but about the roles they perform. About the people::agents themselves, their intentions, personal strategies, intentions, and plans, they know very little, but about activity roles in culture, usually quite a lot is known, plus they can always verify their knowledge (e.g., Google or ask AI if the role is rare).

In many cases, "position" is determined by profession, often used in reliable skill in the job. **Names of common** **roles** **in projects and organizations ---** **these are very often profession names (some jobs/methods/"types of labor", all narrower as the division of labor deepens): manager** **and narrower in part of the tasks solved** **operational** **manager,** **classical** **systems** **"iron"** **engineer and narrower** **engineer-architect,** **vendor and** **narrower** **account manager (dealing with** **key clients and** **opportunities** **for making deals** **with these clients).** **The deepening of the division of labor is just about this.** **Artist,** **narrower** **circus artist and even** **narrower** **trainer, specializations become more and more narrow.** **Roles ---** **these** **are never job titles, not titles of "leadership and subordination", no "lead artist" or “principal artist",** **roles** **indicate** **the** **used** **work method,** **they do not indicate either the** **degree of skill** **of the agent-performer of the role** **in working by this method, nor the** **authority** **of the agent-performer of the role** **to perform such work with the involvement of some resources.**

In various engineering (iron engineering, personality engineering, organization engineering, community engineering) projects, it is necessary to model the position and skill level of all agents as detailed as possible --- the competence of a role performer in the project may both meet the required role and not meet it. "Woe, if a cobbler starts baking pies, and a pastry cook makes boots" --- woe, if a performer with the skill of a cobbler in your project will be baking pies, because "we have no other performers". The taste and harm of such pies you can easily imagine.

Always separate the person and their role in the project: evaluate whether the performer fits the specific role based on their skill/competence in the work methods of the role, but also their focus (role skill, because what good is a pianist who cannot sit at the piano for five minutes?). Therefore, in all meetings and when reading all project documents, it is necessary to separately understand:

-   what method the role performer should use, where this method is described,
-   what their culturally conditioned role is, how it can be called,
-   whether the role performer occupies a position, or "evades" positioning, so that leadership is required as a method of helping to hold the role/occupy a position,
-   what their skill level is in performing the work method of the role they should play and how skilled you yourself are in applying this method, to evaluate their skill level.

This understanding must be absolutely conscious and preferably documented, because it is difficult to keep all this in mind for many roles. Difficulties with documenting your understanding of someone else's and even your own role and the chosen method of work often indicate insufficient thoughtfulness of the question --- "the dog understands everything but cannot speak", the hand hangs over the keyboard but does not write! Remember the description method (which table with types in the columns to fill), this can help.

A systems thinker must also clearly understand that usually, they themselves play some roles in the project, they have some professional/competence position, they are not thoroughly "systemic neutral person above the fray". No, they also occupy some role position, but as a systems thinker they do it consciously (occupation of a position in the SMD-methodology is called "self-determination", we would call it personal strategy-making) and reliably hold this position. A systems thinker self-determines/strategizes their work by role. They also plan resources to master this position (i.e., in a stably and long-held role). They are focused after taking the position, openly presenting it for the convenience of organizing cooperation with them, openly presenting their interests as dependent on the occupied position.

A separate problem is the transition to practically continuous personal strategy-making (self-determination), because a lifelong single choice of position::role for some profession::method work is impossible today, and it is not possible to do this even a few times, re-define/strategize constantly, constantly learn new applied skills, constantly increase intelligence, i.e., engage in education.

Another problem is holding multiple self-determinations/holding multiple strategies, because one has to occupy many role positions in various life contexts, different life situations. What to do with self-determination/personal strategy-making today, not in the past century of "hereditary professions", is detailed in the course "Systems Management" in the part about strategy-making, because in its essence strategy-making (determining the method/way to achieve some results as the basis of work planning) has the same nature for individual and collective agents, i.e., for people and organizations. Continuous during life and multiple strategy-making/self-determination with regular changes in the work methods in which there is skill, role positions and interests for successful work by these methods is called **endless development,** it is necessary for the agent to match the constantly evolving modernity.

**Declaring that you have occupied** **a position ---** **does not mean you are** **a master of the declared work method. You can take the position of a saxophonist, but play the saxophone very poorly,** **not know the notes.** **So be careful with taking positions** **based on strategy-making results, do not forget that to occupy a position you first need to learn how to act in this position, learn to work not anyhow, but by some method. "**Hey, on the barge, do you need any moths? ---**
**We don't need them!---** **Well, right, otherwise I would have moth-eaten for you!".**
